1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,004
(silence)

2
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:33,101
(toddler talk)

3
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:34,502
Uh, we don't get TV in this house,

4
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,171
um, we all have computers.

5
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:39,006
My daughter and my son are three and two

6
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,674
and they each have their own computers,

7
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,511
and they're lined up next to mommy's computers,

8
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:48,048
and um, my little girl is really really super smart.

9
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:50,251
She can use a computer really well,

10
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:53,387
she surfs around this, online and she uses photoshop

11
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:55,389
she uses word, I mean she's only three years old

12
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:57,591
and she can read and write and use a computer

13
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,427
just like an adult, she's pretty amazing.

14
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,728
I didn't plan to be a single mom.

15
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,097
I didn't plan to be stuck in the middle of the desert

16
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:04,165
where I don't know anybody,

17
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,533
it's just kind of all been thrown for a loop.

18
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:09,036
(gun shots)

19
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,206
So at that point I said we gotta arrest him,

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,376
so we arrested him, and he cried like a baby, didn't he.

21
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,378
"I can't go back to jail! Ahhhhhhhh!"

22
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,380
and he just cried like a baby.

23
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,448
I said okay.

24
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:22,750
I gave him the opportunity to make very small

25
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:25,052
reasonable payments, he didn't make any of the payments,

26
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,454
I warned him if he didn't make the payments

27
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:28,222
I was gonna come and take his grandma's car.

28
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:30,558
That's what he forced us to do, and the day that

29
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,494
I took this car his little 87-year-old grandma

30
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,329
or mother was out there with her walker

31
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:36,730
watching us take her car.

32
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,098
And it was one of the hardest things

33
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:39,567
I've ever had to do but you know what?

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,067
Business is business.

35
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,101
(gun shot)

36
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,340
So. Now the clay is pretty much conditioned,

37
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:48,276
it's ready to be worked with.

38
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:51,345
We're gonna give ourselves, a base,

39
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:53,481
and then uh, he will be put into action.

40
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:57,084
I would see if he can find a girlfriend.

41
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,154
Since he's gone throughout this radical surgical procedure,

42
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:02,523
to have his penis re-installed.

43
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,425
Imagine how happy he is when he wakes up

44
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,261
and finds out, he's got a dick again.

45
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:09,263
Wow, you know that's a,

46
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:10,698
that's a big day in the coyote's life.

47
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:11,699
Huh?!

48
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,601
And I knew that, getting this opportunity to be

49
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,437
on a mainstream show, I knew my whole life,

50
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,640
like, once I got out to LA, once I could get on a

51
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:23,277
reality show, and get the opportunity to show people,

52
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,446
like, about me, that that would be the big thing

53
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,547
I need to move forward mainstream.

54
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,682
I just need that one opportunity to get there.

55
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:30,684
No! What happens is it like, it like,

56
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,453
like, you're trying to put it in it like bends.

57
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,455
And you, it's better if it's like a solid one.

58
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,856
That's reality right there.

59
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,124
No, I'm not kidding.

60
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:41,329
But, like, one like this, then it doesn't, it goes faster.

61
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:42,330
(laughing)

62
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:45,466
And he comes from, of course the uh,

63
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,535
story of the old testament, the story of Josean.

64
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:51,639
Um, and this is kind of a modern day adaptation of that.

65
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,140
(unintelligible conversation)

66
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,208
That is amazing,

67
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:56,510
that is amazing and God bless you and take care.

68
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,647
I'm definitely still growing spiritually.

69
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,482
I don't think you can ever quit growing.

70
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,652
There's always room to get closer to God

71
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,421
and things to learn about him and...

72
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,692
ways to change your life and to improve.

73
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,428
It is a mess.

74
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:15,263
You're a mess.

75
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:16,163
It's a mess.

76
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,164
(laughing)

77
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,232
But that's the way gnocchis are.

78
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:19,600
A little bit of a mess.

79
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:22,736
It's like, a guy told me once, when he was painting.

80
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,673
Is that how you, how it was more basic and then he went in.

81
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,408
Well it wasn't more basic, it was just a painting I did

82
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,176
and then one day I took it out and I just

83
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,345
started painting all this other stuff in there

84
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,180
and just went in with this reds and...

85
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,616
I don't, I don't remember what it looked like before,

86
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,551
I can't remember, I just, very hard to keep

87
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:38,786
a band together and I only wanna play

88
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,922
with certain guys that I really love playing with.

89
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:42,923
Cause it all comes together,

90
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,425
it's like summer theatre you know.

91
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,693
Wow!

92
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,696
I got a barn, and I got to, I got to,

93
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,365
I got the instruments, we'll put our own show on!

94
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,366
You know what I mean.

95
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,268
It all still has that, that element.

96
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:57,905
This is uh, one of the Chinatown series.

97
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:01,475
From my home town. After the mill closed.

98
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,210
I mean, pretty much closed.

99
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,244
What'd you get last year,

100
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,546
for your birthday, from Aunt Lynny?

101
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,214
I think a Power Ranger suit.

102
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,716
You got what? No, you didn't!

103
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,552
You didn't get a Power Ranger suit that was for Halloween.

104
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,886
You got an electric guitar--

105
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,388
A 'lectric guitar--

106
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:16,724
A REAL electric guitar!

107
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,659
Why? Because you told aunt Lynny you wanted

108
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,328
to grow up to be a rockstar.

109
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,230
You know what, I just see a beautiful girl

110
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,898
and I just wanna hug her!

111
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:25,966
(laughing)

112
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,569
Well, I love this one right here, so I telling you.

113
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,338
I currently reach out to women and men

114
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,606
in the sex industry and the porn industry

115
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,409
and I absolutely love pulling them out of the pit

116
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:36,944
the porn industry pit.

117
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:43,417
It's 1800 square feet and, the guest house is

118
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:45,819
around 600 square feet.

119
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,855
That little garage area, I don't know.

120
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:51,859
Um, it took me about a year to really get serious

121
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:56,630
about studying, and, it took me three times

122
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:58,666
to pass the test but I did it and,

123
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,602
(deep breath), here I am.

124
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,603
(laughing)

125
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,271
Got into real-estate,

126
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,973
I've been in it for five years.

127
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:09,610
Yup.

128
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,278
Dark and mild.

129
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,780
No, he likes the dark heavy.

130
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:13,847
Dark heavy.

131
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:17,951
When I'm at home, I run around with no makeup on,

132
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,953
a pair of sweatpants, bare foot, a t-shirt,

133
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,556
and I'm usually out in the yard digging.

134
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,824
Because I like to plant things,

135
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:27,361
I like to grow things. Or decorating my house.

136
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:32,032
I like to do crafty things, like, you know, I don't,

137
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,502
I know I don't seem like the domestic goddess!

138
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:37,671
But I, I, I like to make things for the house

139
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:42,309
and I love to cook. And, I'm a very good cook.

140
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,547
I had a little bit, of, a, some bad terrible

141
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,483
terrible news, uh, this April.

142
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:53,887
Um, I was diagnosed with uh, stage three melanoma cancer.

143
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,989
So for the past four or five months

144
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,759
I've been dealing with that and on chemo.

145
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,829
They recommended complete dissection of the lymph-nodes,

146
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,433
and then to be on heavy-dose interferon,

147
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:07,401
which would be uh, intravenous,

148
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:09,336
which I would get five times a week,

149
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,905
for the first month, and then after that,

150
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:15,843
three times a week, for eleven months,

151
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,711
for the rest of the year.

152
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:21,048
And um, it's, it's been tough.

153
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,517
It's actually great here, cause,

154
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:25,686
how many porno stars live here? I know--

155
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,720
There's some more uh,

156
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,422
there's some more coming in uh, Sunset,

157
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:31,459
uh, Houston, uh, Taylor Saint-Claire just moved here.

158
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:32,860
What, whatever happened to uh,

159
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,362
she was really hot, but I loved her.

160
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,764
What happened to that um...

161
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,566
oh godammit, I don't know their names

162
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:39,700
I'm really bad with this, um--

163
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,536
You remember their tits. Yeah.

164
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,805
Oh god, she was um, oh that doesn't make any difference.

165
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:48,108
She was living here for a long time she was so hot.

166
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,110
(unintelligible conversation)

167
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,612
Oh yeah, she just moved outta town,

168
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,380
yeah, she just moved outta town.

169
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,415
And uh, that's the only thing I missed out on in life.

170
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,384
I've done, pretty much everything I wanted.

171
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,720
I did wanna have kids, didn't have the opportunity

172
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,823
to meet the right woman the right time,

173
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,492
so I do kinda miss out on that,

174
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:09,129
but uh, nobody gets everything there's other guys

175
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,964
that have great kids and they love every minute of it

176
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,133
they kinda wish they were me, fantasy wise,

177
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,103
but um, nobody gets everything.

178
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:27,014
*

179
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,916
I started modeling in ninth grade.

180
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,651
My mom put me through modeling school,

181
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,520
I graduated from modeling school,

182
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:35,088
started doing beauty pageants,

183
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,859
and model searches, and bikini contests.

184
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:45,098
So, I was exposed, to, not so much the adult industry

185
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,435
but just knowing that I could make money with my body.

186
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,470
I had a roommate at the time,

187
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:54,107
um, that was a dancer, and she knew an agent,

188
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,809
his name was Jim Salf.

189
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:59,446
He said, "Hey, there's a producer that saw your picture

190
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,014
and he'd like you to come do a movie

191
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:02,182
how would you like to do a movie?"

192
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,986
And I said, uh, well, I've never done a movie before

193
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,188
but sure, I could do it, no problem.

194
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,624
I went down and I had braids like Bo Derek

195
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:13,126
at the time and, did my first scene.

196
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,962
It was a three-way.

197
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,965
I had never even, been with a woman,

198
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,633
I didn't know what to do with a woman,

199
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:22,970
I had, no idea what I was doing.

200
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,838
But the minute those lights hit me,

201
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:27,207
I swear that was where I was supposed to be.

202
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,977
Everyone said do it, do it, do it.

203
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,879
And the more you do the more money you can make

204
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:35,683
dancing on the dance circuit, the more magazines you can do,

205
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,652
the more you're exposed, you can,

206
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:40,688
I mean gosh, I have a sex toy line,

207
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,223
now we wanna do an action figure of you.

208
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,224
Okay!

209
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,060
I mean, all of it was just like, cool!

210
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,897
You know, sign me up! Sure!

211
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,667
I was just having a blast, I mean, there were fans

212
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:57,537
lined up for miles and miles and miles that flew,

213
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,907
I mean some people came from Poland and Berlin,

214
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,176
and come to think of it when I went to Poland,

215
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,179
to um, sign autographs and whatever,

216
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,916
I mean, when I got off the plane I needed a body guard!

217
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:15,222
I mean, for a porn star to be that big, around the world,

218
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:18,592
I mean, it was un-believable, I mean felt like a--

219
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:20,027
I was a true super star!

220
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,096
I mean people, were knocking each other down.

221
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,565
Heeeere's Houston!!!!

222
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:31,538
(cheering)

223
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,707
Over the Dali Lama in the newspaper,

224
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:37,044
I was the headliner. I mean, that's unbelievable.

225
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:41,615
I was still under contract, I was with Metro Productions

226
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:44,217
for a few years, and they're the ones that also produced

227
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,554
uh, the Houston 500, the world's biggest gang-bang.

228
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:52,092
Um, at that point when I first signed with Metro,

229
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:56,730
it was already known going in that I was gonna takeover,

230
00:09:56,764 --> 00:10:00,734
uh, Jasmine Saint-Clair's title and do this gang-bang.

231
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:03,236
So, going into my contract with Metro,

232
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,306
I already knew that I was gonna be doing that,

233
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:10,243
so, I wasn't, I wasn't looking for things to,

234
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,914
oh I've gotta be more crazy and wild,

235
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,617
you know honestly it just all came to me naturally.

236
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:20,020
Like, I mean, I had a labiaplasty,

237
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,690
and that was before a lot of women even knew

238
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,858
that they can get their labia trimmed

239
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:28,195
if you have larger labia lips and you know,

240
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,131
when I did that it was like, oh, it was just a no brainer

241
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:34,601
I'm gonna encase that in lucite and auction it.

242
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
The trimmings.

243
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:38,171
I mean, it's just things just came to me,

244
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:41,274
I was just a publicity whore.

245
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,843
I was good at it.

246
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:46,146
I had invested my money, uh, I bought a home,

247
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:50,217
as well as, um, put a lot of money in mutual funds,

248
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,987
and many years ago when the stock market went kaput,

249
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:57,891
I lost, like, almost all my savings.

250
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,326
And that hurt me.

251
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,962
Um, but I did still have my house that I owned in LA,

252
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,665
um, and then when things got rough of course I sold it,

253
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,735
not for financial reasons but when I wanted

254
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,269
to get out of the industry.

255
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,305
I'm professor of communications studies

256
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,974
and psychology at UCLA.

257
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:20,147
I study a variety of topics, but one of the major areas

258
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,983
that I study is pornography.

259
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,754
I'm Faith, and since 1984 I've done about 600 films.

260
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,922
About a thousand scenes, give or take.

261
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:31,825
Um, I've won several dozen awards for acting

262
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:35,328
in sex performances and fan favorite and this and that.

263
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:39,767
I think it might be up, this year for best non-sex role

264
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,003
cause I've also moved into the occasional character part

265
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,939
that doesn't involve having sex.

266
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:48,008
I write about the sex industry pretty much

267
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:53,213
from the fall of 1995 until the fall of 2007.

268
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:56,683
"The History of X: One Hundred Years of Sex in Film"

269
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,351
is the name of my first book.

270
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,353
I've been in the adult entertainment industry

271
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,757
for basically 35, 36 years, in every capacity.

272
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,393
I started as a writer, became an actor,

273
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:11,098
director, agent, and now I'm sorta the, papa bear

274
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,266
to the adult entertainment industry, protecting

275
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,204
adult welfare, which I run, and, watch over the overaged

276
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,906
juvenile delinquents and what I refer to as

277
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:21,942
the playpen of the damned, which is the X-rated industry.

278
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,377
What we give them in the adult entertainment industry

279
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,747
for a brief shiny moment is immortality,

280
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:29,282
validation, and credibility.

281
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:32,786
Every one of us, no matter how insignificant

282
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,222
we may think we are, wants to be recognized

283
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,257
at one time or another in our lives,

284
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,226
and when you went to those conventions they lined up

285
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,128
at your booth like they were getting signatures

286
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,163
from professional athletes.

287
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:47,134
My parents divorced. My dad took us far away

288
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,169
from our mother, and ran away with us.

289
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,004
He became an alcoholic.

290
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:52,405
Then I moved in with my mom

291
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:56,109
and the family relationship changed, um,

292
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,777
I felt kind of lost.

293
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:02,415
I worked a regular job, um, in an office,

294
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:06,086
for five years, but while I was doing those things

295
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,156
I also found um, a modeling website

296
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,791
and I put my pictures on the website,

297
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:15,095
and then um, you know, I was still working in the office

298
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:20,333
but people were emailing me about doing shoots.

299
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,970
And I thought it would be cool to do,

300
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:26,840
like, bikini stuff, or, even though I never really

301
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:29,809
even walked around in bikinis I thought it would be,

302
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:31,778
kind of neat.

303
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:36,183
So, eventually, I did take a job, um doing,

304
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,285
um, you know they were only asking me

305
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,320
to do nudes and eventually I just did it.

306
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:44,858
I went to my first shoot, in like a hotel room,

307
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:47,961
and um, it was just supposed to be topless,

308
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:51,131
and it, was, it was really scary.

309
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,099
Um--

310
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,003
It was weird.

311
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,206
Well ever since I, since I got into the business,

312
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:02,242
I always got emails, that said that you,

313
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,977
you don't look quite comfortable,

314
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,479
and I think that it was the innocence,

315
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:10,984
that, attracted my, a lot of my fans,

316
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,486
is that I didn't look totally comfortable in anything I did,

317
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,088
and even if I was speaking I didn't look

318
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:17,357
totally comfortable and I never looked confident,

319
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,427
I wasn't very verbal, I wasn't, you know,

320
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,897
over the top with the noises or anything, um.

321
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:29,536
I dunno, I just started feeling, really depressed about it.

322
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:30,537
Honestly.

323
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,274
And, then I hit rock bottom myself,

324
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:37,410
emotionally, where I um, got really upset

325
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:41,014
and I'd go in the bathroom and I threw a glass

326
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:44,384
on the ground and then I um, just crying

327
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:48,855
and fall to the ground and just started like,

328
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,124
pounding my wrists into the glass, and blood was,

329
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:53,393
just started going everywhere, and...

330
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,130
I dunno, I just kinda lost that hope.

331
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,033
I did have a stalker, um, he started off

332
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,468
just sending me hate-mail.

333
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,903
He's an atheist, so he was pretty much,

334
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:06,073
putting down what I believe in

335
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,541
and trying to get me to debate him.

336
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,211
He, heh, became obsessed with me

337
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,547
and developed like this, crush on me.

338
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,217
And then I told him we would never date,

339
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,286
I don't know you I don't know where you live,

340
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,388
you're too young, blah blah blah.

341
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,257
And um, he flipped out.

342
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,392
(nervous laughing)

343
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,094
The thing that pushed me to the edge

344
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,396
was he said he was gonna, um, he wanted

345
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,098
to bash my head into the concrete

346
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,066
until my brains spilled out.

347
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,502
And then kill my cat and stuff like that.

348
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:38,638
A few fans had emailed me the last year or so

349
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,241
and said they were praying for me

350
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,410
and that they were not looking at porn anymore,

351
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,113
and, you know, and then I had this other guy saying

352
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:47,914
you need to put a warning on your website

353
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,249
because kids can see this

354
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,917
my fourteen-year-old son found this, and then--

355
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,252
Just all kinds of people were like,

356
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,422
sending me these emails, random emails and--

357
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,091
You know it uh, and of course I would,

358
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,592
I was always kind of sympathetic

359
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:03,496
to whatever they said but, um, there was some,

360
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,265
you know I was still kind of hardened too,

361
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,200
at the same time, because I was like well,

362
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,636
I can't do anything else, this is what I'm good at.

363
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,438
This is all that, I know.

364
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:15,675
And, I kind of believed it at the time.

365
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,510
I didn't have anybody you know,

366
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,979
saying, you're better than that.

367
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:22,015
So, um... (nervous laughing)

368
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,518
Some adult stars do "find god" and leave,

369
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:28,288
but those are people who needed,

370
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,124
who needed to be gone anyway, and did not have

371
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,559
the personal strength to do it and so they do

372
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,162
look outside for something to help them leave.

373
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,496
Um, there are plenty of people in the business

374
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,465
who really shouldn't be here, because they have

375
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,634
conflict about-- if I was-, if I'd been raised

376
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,704
to be ashamed of my body, and to feel bad

377
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,307
about men and their and the horrible desires,

378
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,511
but, did porn for other reasons eventually those two things

379
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,413
are gonna co-, wheels are gonna come off the bus.

380
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,648
I can only deny it so long, people try to deny,

381
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,085
they stuff their feelings with, with drugs,

382
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,187
and alcohol, or whatever it is they stuff their feelings with

383
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,222
and after a six months, one year, five year,

384
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:04,557
ten years, whatever it finally goes you know what?

385
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:05,692
I can't do this anymore.

386
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,595
Because for religion and especially western religion,

387
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,597
especially Christianity says I love you,

388
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,432
I forgive you, you can come home now.

389
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:15,235
And I will not push you out.

390
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:18,671
And so that is incredibly powerful and incredibly potent

391
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:22,342
to have someone finally say I don't shame you.

392
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,376
I love you.

393
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,512
You're welcome here.

394
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,046
Sign me up!

395
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,381
When you're involved in this industry

396
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:29,749
you lose your humanity.

397
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,684
You're no longer treated as a human being

398
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,754
by eighty percent of people out there.

399
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,556
You're now, now scum.

400
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,759
Like they maybe wanna, do certain things with you.

401
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,694
But then, you're still scum.

402
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,297
And, like if, they may be thrilled to have

403
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,366
a roll in the sac with you but when they leave,

404
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,401
when you leave they're gonna wanna burn the sheets.

405
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:51,538
Uh, ah, I got into porn by accident.

406
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,740
It wasn't something I planned on doing,

407
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:57,210
uh, probably mighta been the, the least likely thing

408
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,045
I thought I woulda done.

409
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,447
I was singing in bands after I,

410
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,382
a baseball thing didn't work out,

411
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,418
uh, I knew I could sing so I started singing in rock bands.

412
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:08,388
And of course like all struggling musicians

413
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,057
you gotta make a little extra dough on the side.

414
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,394
It actually, my, my first naked job I was a nude art model

415
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,230
for like you know college art classes and stuff like that.

416
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,399
And I was really kinda shy but not about my body

417
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,169
just about talking I was kinda shy about talking.

418
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:23,436
but yeah I'd get naked in front of people

419
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,772
so I did that and a couple girls in one of the classes

420
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,675
asked to take some pictures of me and they did and--

421
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,577
They came out pretty good and they said can we send them

422
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,779
to some magazines I said I don't care do what you want.

423
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,080
And they sent'em out and and next thing I know

424
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,317
I got a letter from Playgirl, and, but High Society

425
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,453
said they like to do a boy/girl thing but I said alright.

426
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,455
So it was the first thing I ever did.

427
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,090
And they had a woman editor and at the end

428
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,325
of the shoot she goes you know uh,

429
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,594
I noticed you were taking care of business pretty good,

430
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,696
did you ever think about doing a porn movie

431
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,464
cause I got some connections.

432
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:53,833
And I go, I never really thought about it, no.

433
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:57,437
She goes well you know, I think, I can get you 250 bucks.

434
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,639
Like, 250 bucks man!

435
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,541
1978 that was some good cash,

436
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:04,110
that's what I was making a week!

437
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,279
So I said uh, alright I'll try it, you know.

438
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:09,349
So I did it and uh, guess I was good at it

439
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,683
cause they kept calling me back.

440
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:13,220
And uh, that's kinda how it got started.

441
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:15,555
I, I used to say it's like borrowing somebody's body

442
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:16,656
to masturbate with.

443
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,391
Uh, excuse me, if you're not busy do you mind

444
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:20,493
if I jerk off in your pussy with my dick?

445
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,730
Uh, it's kinda like that, which it's not bad,

446
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:27,500
I mean you know, better than real jerkin' off, but--

447
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,236
When I first started producing up-and-comers

448
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,471
I get this letter in the mail and I open it up

449
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:35,174
and I see this unbelievably, good-looking,

450
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,710
very young looking blonde girl,

451
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:40,647
with beautiful natural boobs,

452
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,416
little baby face, and she wants to know

453
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,253
if I can help her get in the porn biz.

454
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,221
Girl's name was Jenna Jameson.

455
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:49,589
I remember saying this I mean holy christ

456
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:50,657
if I get this girl to shoot for me

457
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,359
we're gonna sell some tapes.

458
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,693
I said well if you don't wanna do guys you know

459
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,161
I'll let you pick whatever girl you want

460
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,331
if you wanna do that. And she liked girls.

461
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,500
so she picked this girl that I happened to be working with

462
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,169
that day who was doing her first movie, Kylie Ireland,

463
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,238
so Kylie and Jenna were doing their thing together

464
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:10,176
and uh, everything was going good, and they took

465
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,911
a little break and while they were lying there I--

466
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,347
I think I said something like,

467
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,849
man Jenna that's a tasty looking pussy you got.

468
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,253
And I believe she said well why don't you come in

469
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:21,254
and taste it.

470
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:22,855
I went--

471
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,757
Okay, I was doing the camera but I handed it

472
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:29,796
to my assistant, Bob hold onto this, start shooting.

473
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,864
So I get in there and I start going down on her

474
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,401
and she starts squealing that little squeal that she had

475
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,903
and um, I'm guessing she's kinda liking it you know,

476
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:39,606
and seemed like she was getting off and everything's good

477
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:42,309
and I said man, I am so fuckin' horny now.

478
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:43,910
I said would you guys mind maybe like,

479
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,545
giving me a double blowjob or something?

480
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:49,215
And they said sure, we can do that, and I'm like--

481
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,450
Thank you, thank you!

482
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:54,721
And they did and it went well and a week later

483
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,789
she kinda called me back and said you know what

484
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:58,491
you weren't so bad I think I could probably do

485
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,893
a boy girl thing with you and the rest is

486
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,562
kinda history after that.

487
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,298
Getting "It's a Daddy Thing" number three!

488
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:07,233
Old man, can make a comeback!

489
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,234
Yeah!

490
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,570
So there baby, no viagra yet!

491
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,641
Um, and it, you know, it's cool you do your thing,

492
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:17,510
you go home, you came, you relax you know but,

493
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:19,579
I'm kind of an affectionate kinda guy,

494
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,814
and so I kinda miss that part of it and that's why

495
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:23,282
I still like having a relationship,

496
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,685
when it happens, you know.

497
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:28,688
And uh, you know for example eh, Tera Patrick man,

498
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,256
not only was she incredible in bed

499
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,925
but there was just, I just liked her.

500
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,628
And, that that, sense of humor and the craziness,

501
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:38,665
a little bit different, you know.

502
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:42,502
So, I hadn't dated anybody in so long when I met her

503
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:45,004
I forgot how to do it, and uh,

504
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,873
I did ask her out to dinner twice,

505
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,541
and we went out to dinner and we had a good time

506
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:51,644
but I dropped her off at her place without asking her

507
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:53,446
if I could, come in.

508
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,883
And I don't know eh, I might have,

509
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,385
she mighta thought I was weird.

510
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:01,721
I already had sex with her a couple of times, on camera,

511
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:02,855
and she mighta thought it was weird that

512
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,957
I didn't wanna come up and finish the date,

513
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,293
but I was kinda showing her that I wasn't just there

514
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:11,631
for the sex, and, maybe it wasn't a good move

515
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,400
cause you leave a beautiful woman like that

516
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,034
alone for too long and somebody else is gonna come along

517
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,636
and somebody else did come along and,

518
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,904
that was that.

519
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,507
She made it today, this is Tera Patrick.

520
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,441
Hello.

521
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,043
And uh, Tera is reasonably known in the business

522
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,546
and hasn't even worked that often.

523
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:27,514
Apparently.

524
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,349
Um.

525
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,819
I was just trying to pace myself right now.

526
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,754
One of my all time favorites.

527
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,596
Most of the people who seek it out don't have means

528
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:48,000
of making that kind of money by other means.

529
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,737
I mean very few women say hmm,

530
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,705
I'm going to become a surgeon or I'm going

531
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:55,742
to become a pornography star.

532
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:57,444
This country does not raise people

533
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:58,511
with a very good work ethic.

534
00:22:58,545 --> 00:22:59,879
They don't know how to do anything else.

535
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:01,514
They don't know how to do retail,

536
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:05,452
they don't know how to do Excel spreadsheets.

537
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:08,354
Many people who make their way to adult entertainment,

538
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,123
like rock-and-roll, are not suited for nine-to-five work.

539
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,528
I, ran away from home at sixteen

540
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,530
and was living on the streets at seventeen.

541
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:20,700
Uh, everything I owned was in two garbage bags.

542
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:25,472
Um, my parents were saying I hope you just kill yourself

543
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:27,540
and make life a lot easier for the rest of us.

544
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:30,443
Uh, it was just on and on and on so there I was

545
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:32,812
out on the streets and then, when I got taken in

546
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:36,048
with a foster family, um, I made sure that

547
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:37,917
I kept finishing school with good grades

548
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,418
because that was gonna be my future that

549
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:40,787
was gonna be my ticket outta there and then

550
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,389
when I went to college on full academic scholarship

551
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,757
I never actually went to classes.

552
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,959
I said okay I've got free room and board,

553
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:47,994
I need to make money.

554
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:50,096
I need to get some sort of security and stability

555
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:53,900
in my life so I don't have to turn tricks

556
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,568
to get food to eat.

557
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:59,005
So I took up stripping, I went to all the local strip bars,

558
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,675
and from there I started doing magazines in New York City.

559
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:03,776
I would take a train to New York CIty

560
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,612
on weekends and do magazines.

561
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:09,415
And then, uh, a photographer said he knew a director

562
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,450
in California named Bud Lee who could direct me

563
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:12,919
in some movies if I wanted to do that.

564
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:16,422
So um, I packed up my suitcase and a teddy bear

565
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,157
and went out to LA.

566
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,595
Made a movie for Bud Lee, married him, didn't come back.

567
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:25,097
The reason that I wanted to do porn,

568
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:28,801
even though I was so smart, Miss MENSA and all that is

569
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:32,104
uh, it's precisely because I wanted to stop being known

570
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:36,108
as the nerd the geek the, the one that you come over

571
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,677
and you be nice to me just so you can copy off

572
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,512
of my tests, you know.

573
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:40,547
(laughing)

574
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,615
I would hang out with some of my misfit friends

575
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:44,450
and they had, they had adult magazines

576
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,118
hidden under their bed and they would look at them

577
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,987
and I would be peeking over their shoulder going

578
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,522
I wish someone would look at me like that.

579
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:52,559
And that was just like my wildest fantasy that

580
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:53,893
someone would think that I was pretty

581
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:56,796
and sexy and, woo!

582
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,465
All my life I'd just been the nerd and the geek.

583
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,133
So it was like a fantasy come true for me that

584
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,636
someone wanted to see me on the cover of a magazine.

585
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,038
When I got to porn it was like wait, I get to pick

586
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:07,974
which one of these good-looking guys I wanna sleep with?

587
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,576
And uh, you're gonna pay me for it

588
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:10,710
and then you're gonna put me on a box cover

589
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:11,711
and give me tons of money?

590
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:12,712
(laughing)

591
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:14,847
It was just uh, a really big step up

592
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:16,883
from where I was coming from.

593
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,886
Porn wasn't all that much of a mental challenge

594
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,589
for me shall we say, um, standing there

595
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:25,825
and saying my silly lines just, it didn't take up

596
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,026
a whole lot of my day so meanwhile

597
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,094
you got a lot of time to sit around

598
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,830
and wait so uh, I just kept myself busy

599
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,999
by learning every single job on the set.

600
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,002
Um, I (laughing) I would get

601
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,837
the grips to take me down to the grip truck

602
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,005
and show me the names of everything on there

603
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,507
and teach me how to do everything by showing up

604
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,075
with my little grip belt and my shorts and my gloves

605
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:44,210
and no shirt on.

606
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:45,344
(laughing)

607
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,113
and I would ask very nicely if they would teach me

608
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:49,749
their job and they did, and uh,

609
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,183
much the same way I learned editing,

610
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,019
directing, producing, scriptwriting,

611
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,688
um, every job on the set I've gotten.

612
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:57,957
If you look on IMDB my name has got all credits next to it

613
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,026
I did everything.

614
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,695
I even designed my own box covers.

615
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:05,632
Um, what made me different was I was the first half-asian

616
00:26:05,665 --> 00:26:07,867
to become an A-list star in the business.

617
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,770
Um, before I'd started there was the white girls

618
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,038
and the black girls and the asian girls

619
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,640
and each had their own separate genre,

620
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:16,943
and, they didn't mix, you, you don't put

621
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:18,210
an asian girl in a white girl movie.

622
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,211
(laughing)

623
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,379
It's just the way it was.

624
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,649
And then when I came in and I was only half-asian

625
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:24,751
the features were soft enough that they could still

626
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:26,052
put me on a cover and I could still be a white girl,

627
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,220
or and asian girl, they could play me either way.

628
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,556
Or they could play me as an Indian or a Gypsy,

629
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,423
or, Greek girl!

630
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:33,225
They gave me all the different roles.

631
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,727
So they just, they wound up using

632
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:36,228
my look as very versatile.

633
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,631
And so I became the first "cross-over" star

634
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:42,134
from a minority, and then uh, I guess they did pretty well

635
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:44,570
with me cause after I left Vivid they got Koby Tie,

636
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,807
who was full asian, so, I kinda opened the door

637
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,976
for the minorities to become A-listers.

638
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:51,911
I, I hated doing live appearance.

639
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,980
Oh I'm getting sweaty just looking at this picture.

640
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:55,181
(laughing) Yeah.

641
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,650
I spent like all year long dreading the CES Show.

642
00:26:57,684 --> 00:27:00,086
I would just have to keep telling myself

643
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,087
they're more scared than you are,

644
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,154
they're more scared than you are.

645
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:04,256
Cause I'd smile and I'd say "So what's your name?"

646
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,593
and they'd go-- (laughing)

647
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,663
they'd just look at me. Okay what's your name?!

648
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:12,598
If you see my very first interviews from when

649
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,766
I was nineteen, twenty years old,

650
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,935
I said I'm gonna retire when I'm thirty.

651
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:16,936
And people would laugh and say

652
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:17,970
oh you've got it all planned out.

653
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:19,872
There really wasn't any question about it.

654
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:24,944
I had, gotten married, and, then divorced.

655
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:28,781
And I met someone who had adult bookstores.

656
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:31,150
So I basically got my introduction

657
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:33,953
to the adult entertainment world through working

658
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:37,123
in adult bookstores, and then consequently

659
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:40,860
owning adult bookstores and I saw the women

660
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:44,731
that were doing movies at the time and, I was just,

661
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:49,335
amazed, because, they had pimples on their rear-ends,

662
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:51,904
they had on no makeup, their feet were dirty,

663
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:54,807
their hair was dirty, and I thought my god,

664
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:58,210
this is not a really good representation of women.

665
00:27:58,244 --> 00:27:59,345
I wanna do that.

666
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:05,818
I mean I had done, um, a few magazines and a few uh,

667
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,755
like, 8 mm loops, and then I came to California,

668
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:11,991
and I picked up one of the free papers and,

669
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,692
there was an ad.

670
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:16,996
My family was very, very okay with what I did

671
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,899
because I did tell them what I was about to do

672
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:22,368
before I actually did anything.

673
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:25,404
I mean I'd done a couple of photo shoots,

674
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,040
and decided that I needed to tell my family

675
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:31,343
before it got out there because I didn't want

676
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,880
them finding out from someone else.

677
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:36,282
And they're like well do, you think

678
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:37,549
you can make money at it?

679
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,852
You think you can have a good career and be happy doing this?

680
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:44,123
And I said yes I do, and they said good, go do it.

681
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:48,427
We had a very small community of people,

682
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,931
of players, that we all worked with.

683
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:54,867
And we all worked with each other quite a bit.

684
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,103
So the community was small, we were familiar

685
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:59,872
with one another, and, we actu--

686
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:02,809
it's like when you, have a, a new boyfriend

687
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:05,211
or new girlfriend or a new husband or wife,

688
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,880
it takes a little while before you know what

689
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:09,982
pushes their buttons, what turns them on

690
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,953
what makes them feel good, and then it starts

691
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:19,458
to become very intimate, and, you can actually,

692
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,928
have an intimate relationship with the person

693
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:23,429
you're working with on screen,

694
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:25,798
and be fond of them after the movie is over.

695
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:31,770
Um, but they're just generally sweet nice people.

696
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:35,741
I was being offered parts in movies,

697
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,845
in, or photo shoots or what have you,

698
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:41,814
and they didn't want to pay me the amount of money

699
00:29:41,848 --> 00:29:46,285
I wanted, and I said no. I just, I held out.

700
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:51,257
So, um, and subsequently I started stripping,

701
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,927
going across the, basically across the world stripping.

702
00:29:54,961 --> 00:30:00,199
And uh, doing photo shoots with Club Magazine predominantly.

703
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:02,434
And um, so they didn't see me in front,

704
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:04,003
people didn't see me in front of the camera

705
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:07,039
so they thought okay, she's retired.

706
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:08,875
I've been retired and come back so many times

707
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:10,977
I can't keep track anymore.

708
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,811
I've also been dead a few times.

709
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,784
I saw an add in the paper it said "Nude fun, big bucks."

710
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,153
and uh, it was an audition for an X-rated movie.

711
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:23,289
Two days later I get a call from the producer,

712
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,491
they wanna give me a part in the movie.

713
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:27,459
I hadn't planned on that.

714
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:32,298
At the time, I had applied to the Hebrew Union Seminary

715
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:35,334
in Cincinnati, where they uh, train people

716
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,903
to become Rabbis.

717
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:40,372
So I'm trying to measure, do I wanna do this,

718
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:42,341
or do I wanna be in a porn movie because it seems

719
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:44,310
if I take the part in the porn movie I maybe,

720
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:49,315
um, cutting some of my options off, for future life.

721
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:53,519
And the uh, seminary in Cincinnati said we'll take you

722
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:56,822
but the first two years you have to go to Jerusalem

723
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,925
and study Aramaic, which, I would rather go

724
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:02,261
to Cleveland and study their sewer system.

725
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,330
Um, no interest there.

726
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,266
So I decided I would make the porn movie.

727
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:10,903
And, in any case the kind of Rabbi I would become,

728
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:13,539
would be the kind that could've made a porn movie.

729
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:16,042
And uh, I went ahead and did the job.

730
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:19,011
I think I had to become a sex star just

731
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:21,013
to come back to normal!

732
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:24,083
Cause I'd been so humiliated by being the fat kid!

733
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:26,852
I had the largest breasts in the seventh grade!

734
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,220
The guys would make fun of me

735
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:30,356
and point at me and tease me!

736
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,424
Do you know how deep those scars go?!

737
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:33,926
That's ugly shit!

738
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,196
Those are the people that become centerfolds!

739
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,931
Cause they got something to prove.

740
00:31:38,965 --> 00:31:42,868
I was lucky enough to uh, be in the era when they were

741
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,370
actually trying to make movies where you needed

742
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,038
to remember lines.

743
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:48,140
And I had the, I was good at that.

744
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:51,477
So, I got hired for my acting ability,

745
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,113
which being a good actor in porn,

746
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:57,049
is like being the wisest man in the kingdom of the fools.

747
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,384
He promised that I could fuck you next.

748
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,585
He what?!

749
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:01,420
Gah!

750
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:02,921
Ow!

751
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:03,956
(screaming)

752
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,457
Let him alone!

753
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:06,592
I said let him alone!

754
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:07,393
(shrieking)

755
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,628
Ow! Ah, oh uh!

756
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,630
Get the fuck outta here!

757
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,133
My ankle! Ow, my ankle!

758
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,402
I was terrible at the sex.

759
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,403
Just rotten!

760
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,005
I was just so traumatized by it.

761
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:23,075
But I eventually did learn how to have sex on camera.

762
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:27,346
I was on the beach in San Diego and uh, I was by myself.

763
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:30,282
and I'm sitting there, and I notice there's a,

764
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:33,452
really beautiful woman, laying on a towel and so

765
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:36,588
my gaze drifts over to her and her boyfriend looks at me

766
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:39,091
and sees her-- and I look away.

767
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,592
And then eventually I'd drift back and I'm looking

768
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:42,995
at her again and the boyfriend sees me looking

769
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:44,430
at her again and I'm like shit.

770
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,266
Well the guy gets up, and he starts walkin'

771
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:51,203
over towards me and I'm going Oh no! Here we go.

772
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:53,039
You know, this is gonna get ugly.

773
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:54,506
And he gets close to me and I,

774
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,376
I'm just clenching my fist ready to defend myself.

775
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:59,511
The guy's a monster, I'm gonna get killed,

776
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:02,548
I know it, and he leans in and he says

777
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:04,183
"Were you in Insatiable?"

778
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:06,652
(laughing) And I went YES! YES!

779
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:08,520
I was so happy that's what it was, he recognized me

780
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:10,622
from the movie business and he wasn't gonna

781
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,958
kick my ass it was a true delight.

782
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:13,959
A true delight.

783
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,394
We became friends at that point.

784
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:17,129
I hadn't told my parents that I was doing this.

785
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:20,566
I told them I had, was doing commercials

786
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:25,003
and low-budget nothing, and, well, that I,

787
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:27,473
I knew that they weren't gonna be.

788
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,408
I didn't suspect they would be very approving

789
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,177
of this kinda stuff.

790
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:34,146
I made the original call prepared

791
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,315
to become the black sheep of the family.

792
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,350
It didn't happen.

793
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:41,253
I'm sure they were less than thrilled.

794
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:43,089
When my mother would be at the grocery store

795
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:45,224
the next day and they say

796
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:46,325
"Good to see you, how you doing?

797
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,993
What's going on?"

798
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,361
"Well! My son the doctor's

799
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:52,030
coming back from Israel, and my other son,

800
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:54,300
he makes shmackle movies in California!"

801
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:59,505
Well I think people may have a negative reaction

802
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:04,443
to someone who's a porn star for a combination of reasons.

803
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:07,746
One is, somebody who seems to indiscriminately

804
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,182
be willing to sleep with anyone,

805
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:13,219
whether it's on film or not, is,

806
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:16,088
no matter what people say, still not somebody

807
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:18,390
who's particularly admired and,

808
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:22,761
again may pose a threat to many relationships.

809
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,731
It is legal work, but it's fucking.

810
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:28,534
With pictures.

811
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,036
People say "you should, should go into politics"

812
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,038
There's too many pictures with dicks in my ass,

813
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,073
it's like, it's not going to happen.

814
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,576
It happened by happenstance.

815
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:41,213
I came up with some friends and I went to a club

816
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:46,051
called The Rainbow, and, I met there Althea Flint,

817
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:50,055
the wife of Larry Flint, and a photographer that

818
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:53,659
she had in tow, and they approached me and invited me

819
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:57,496
to their table, and asked me if I wanted to go to a club

820
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,765
and have some drinks and I did.

821
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:02,601
And she was, doing an interview for Sting,

822
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:05,571
and we were up there looking to meet some rockstars,

823
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:06,805
you know, we were just girls.

824
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,640
Doing our thing.

825
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:12,144
And she took us in her limo, she had this black limo that

826
00:35:12,178 --> 00:35:14,446
had this Think Pink on the license plate and this,

827
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,515
I think it was a naked lady on the side of it.

828
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,784
And I was so impressed by that.

829
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:21,420
She said what do you do and I said I'm a model

830
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:22,421
and she said Wow!

831
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,191
I sh-- you know, I, I own Hustler Magazine

832
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:26,592
and we're gonna put you in Hustler.

833
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,494
So, that was that!

834
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:33,465
Um, I went into Hustler and um, started doing magazines.

835
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:37,135
My brother found out and, he had tried to talk me into it

836
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:39,438
many times, because everybody always said Hey Buck!

837
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,540
Can you get your sister to do a movie oh my god!

838
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:45,511
And, um, you know, we never worked together,

839
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:49,848
on set, but, we always championed each other's careers.

840
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:54,220
And so my brother said to me, um, I want you to do a movie.

841
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:55,621
And he set it up with Sin City,

842
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,624
it was actually done for Sin City and it was called

843
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,692
Babewatch, and it was for my brother's Babewatch series,

844
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:03,395
cause he said if you're gonna do movies for anybody,

845
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:06,465
you have to do, you have to do one for me, sis,

846
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,166
so I said okay I will.

847
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,369
And the sex was real, you know,

848
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:13,472
you'd say, how do you want the blow-job?

849
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,307
And he'd say, how do you like the blowjob?

850
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:17,643
And that would be it, you know and that,

851
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,177
we would build off of that.

852
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:20,812
You know, I was the kinda person,

853
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,314
it, I lived a life of excess,

854
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:25,517
and people would invite me to parties,

855
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:27,152
and they would think Wow!

856
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:31,156
if I offer her some party tools, then,

857
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,424
I'm gonna have my night set up,

858
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:33,892
I'm gonna wind up getting laid all night

859
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,494
by this beautiful porn star.

860
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,830
And then as my addiction went through another door,

861
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,500
they'd hand me the bag of coke and I'd wind up

862
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:42,901
in the bathroom all night, you know,

863
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,770
and you wouldn't be able to drag me out of the bathroom

864
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:46,672
and I'd be like don't touch me!

865
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:47,739
and oh!

866
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:52,878
And all of my life started to kind of spiral.

867
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:56,615
I wound up getting arrested, um, on the highway,

868
00:36:56,648 --> 00:37:00,252
and the police knew exactly who I was,

869
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:02,721
when I got arrested, and, they wanted

870
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:05,190
to make an example of me with the court system.

871
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,558
They knew that I was, you know,

872
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:09,928
a big porn star, and um, the gig was up.

873
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,797
And I had to face it.

874
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,199
And it was the greatest thing that ever happened

875
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,568
to me when I look back on it now because,

876
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:18,970
it really brought me into reality.

877
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:23,375
For the women, they're much more damned by society

878
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:26,312
because no matter how sanctified they are,

879
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:27,879
they're still considered to be whores,

880
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,615
and it's getting worse and worse and worse

881
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:32,451
because a lot of them have turned to,

882
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:33,752
what I am vehemently opposed to,

883
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:36,555
the escort services, to further their career.

884
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:42,227
In many ways, it has a dehumanizing quality,

885
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,298
because what you're responding to are a set of,

886
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:48,300
physical cues.

887
00:37:48,334 --> 00:37:50,402
You are responding to the body,

888
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:53,939
and you're responding to the sexual acts per say

889
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:57,343
in a way that is quite animalistic.

890
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:03,515
And, having a more full depiction of the person

891
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:08,487
may even detract from the ability to use it purely

892
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,924
as masturbatory or other kind of sexual stimulation.

893
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,993
You can take every other category,

894
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,962
every other idea, every other thought.

895
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:20,432
Basically happiness and success in life all boils down

896
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:22,834
to what are the quality of your bonds with other people.

897
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:25,371
Having anything to do with the adult industry hacks

898
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:28,340
away those bonds, so you're isolated, alienated,

899
00:38:28,374 --> 00:38:30,642
um, pushed away to the margins,

900
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:32,611
and not treated as a human being.

901
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:35,981
That's a recipe for disaster, for me and for anyone else.

902
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:40,285
Um, when I was in college a couple of us on the dance team

903
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,553
worked at Hooters so I was working at Hooters,

904
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:43,789
I love doing that, a lot of the girls at Hooters

905
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,791
were telling me how I would make a lot of money stripping

906
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,960
and then I had a boyfriend in college who brought me,

907
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,796
I went with him and his friends to a strip club one night

908
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,964
because they always used to go watch amateur night.

909
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:54,299
He's like I think you could win,

910
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,701
I think you could beat these girls at amateur night

911
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:58,670
so I entered and I won, I got first place out of twelve girls

912
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:02,307
in the amateur contest, and I got $500.

913
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,643
So I was like this is a really cool job I get to drink,

914
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,545
and dance and make money.

915
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:08,414
This is way better than anything else I can imagine.

916
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:10,649
When I was twenty-one I used to watch a lot

917
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,652
of those cinemaX movies and so I went to uh,

918
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,821
Blockbuster and I got the address off the box

919
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,657
of a cinemaX movie and I mailed some Polaroids

920
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,859
of myself and a a few headshots I had taken,

921
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:22,894
um, like, and just pictures and I mailed it

922
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:24,830
and I wrote this letter about how I think I'd really like

923
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:25,831
to be in the movies.

924
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,666
And I heard nothing and then three months later

925
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,334
I actually got a call from Playboy.

926
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,902
Coming to this industry I pretty much came into it

927
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:34,072
thinking okay I'm going to somehow be one

928
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,508
of the most well-known pornstars of all time.

929
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:38,076
I wouldn't wanna come into it and just be another girl

930
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,845
that was around for two years

931
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,380
and then have to go be a hooker. You know.

932
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:44,015
After I did the Hus- the Playboy thing,

933
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:47,085
um, I shot for Hustler, the next month I came out to LA,

934
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:49,621
um, within three weeks after shooting for Hustler,

935
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:52,791
um, his wife and his dau- uh his sister,

936
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:54,025
or, his daughter, told me how much they loved me

937
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,795
and they ended up taking me on the Larry Flint Freedom Tour.

938
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:59,364
They chose four girls to go with Larry Flint

939
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,032
to like different Hustler stores on the freedom tour

940
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,101
and they chose me and then Hustler had me,

941
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,036
my very first day being on the show um,

942
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,638
a Hustler chose me to sign at their booth,

943
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:09,074
cause they don't have contract girls they pick girls.

944
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:10,976
And then a month later there was a Magic Convention

945
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:13,044
which is a clothing convention and Hustler was launching

946
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:15,714
their clothing and Hustler had chosen me

947
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,783
to be the model of their clothing and they made,

948
00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:19,050
you know, pictures of me modeling it.

949
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:20,986
So I really didn't think about life after porn

950
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:23,054
because I just couldn't believe how like,

951
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,790
all these things kept happening.

952
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:26,458
I mean just the things that happened to me as a new girl

953
00:40:26,492 --> 00:40:28,460
in porn don't happen to most new girls I mean,

954
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:30,395
I met Larry Flint um,

955
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,764
pretty much my second month in the business.

956
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:33,999
So I didn't think about life after.

957
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:35,567
I just said-- I just always said

958
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:37,102
I'm gonna get married and have kids.

959
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,804
I used to say by twenty-seven.

960
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:40,472
Now I say I wanna get married by thirty

961
00:40:40,506 --> 00:40:41,973
and have kids by thirty-two.

962
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:43,775
When I was married I only did girl-girl.

963
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:45,143
I left my husband and did boy-girl.

964
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:48,514
Um, when I got back with my husband at kickass

965
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:50,916
I only did girl-girl again, we split up,

966
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,050
I did boy-girl, heh!

967
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,686
Then I took like a hiatus for about six-seven months

968
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,921
and didn't shoot anything.

969
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,155
And that's when I met this guy,

970
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,924
um, who's my, ended up becoming my fiance,

971
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,126
but we were dating, and I didn't do boy-girl

972
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,028
when I was with him for the first six months,

973
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:05,096
and then he was like, don't you think you should go

974
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,799
get a new porn contract because that's extra income

975
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:08,800
we can have every month.

976
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:10,769
And I was like well, you want me to have sex

977
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:11,837
with other guys?

978
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,438
And he was like well, it's only six times a year

979
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,973
you're gonna do it, and it's with a condom.

980
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:16,041
I was like okay.

981
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:17,776
Then of course, like, two days before the movie

982
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,111
my ex was like, I don't want you having sex with other guys.

983
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:21,112
Arrrrg! Arr!

984
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,447
Let go of me!

985
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,783
Your derriÃ¨re may be pretty, but that don't mean

986
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,953
it's bull-worked from a promiscuous lashing.

987
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:28,453
SLAP!

988
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,120
Ow!

989
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:32,123
*

990
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:33,458
Every two-and-a-half months I'd have to shoot

991
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,127
a boy-girl scene and er- usually about two days before

992
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:37,629
he would start being really mean to me,

993
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:39,631
and calling me names, even though he was the one

994
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:40,866
who wanted me to do the movies.

995
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:42,968
Then, on the day when I'd go to shoot the movie

996
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,970
he'd go out with his friends and get really drunk,

997
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,038
then he usually would not kiss me or anything

998
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:48,740
for two days later, then when my check would come in

999
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:51,509
he's like that's my check, I let you have sex with other people.

1000
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:53,144
And then when I would be asleep sometimes,

1001
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:55,647
I'd be asleep and I'd hear him watching my movies.

1002
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:56,915
He'd go and put it in like slow motion

1003
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:58,049
and make sure the guy wore a condom

1004
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:59,718
and I wasn't lying about it.

1005
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:01,720
Um, let's see.

1006
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:03,488
The most I ever made in a month was probably when

1007
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,156
I was running for governor because my website

1008
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,725
was making around twenty-thousand a month

1009
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:09,928
and then my online store selling t-shirts and buttons

1010
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,730
made about ten-fifteen thousand a month,

1011
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:13,498
and, I felt really bad cause I didn't have time

1012
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,833
to mail'em all out so I just ended up

1013
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,668
not mailing people their orders.

1014
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:17,736
I feel really bad about that.

1015
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:20,171
Um, and then my contract was six thousand a month

1016
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:22,073
and I was feature dancing, at that time

1017
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:24,009
feature dancing used to pay a lot more.

1018
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,077
That was like, six thousand for like, three weeks.

1019
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:27,078
I dunno how much that is,

1020
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:29,180
maybe like 50, 60 thousand in a month.

1021
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:30,281
That's probably the most.

1022
00:42:30,315 --> 00:42:32,183
And then I won a game show around that same time.

1023
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,119
I won a game show Who Wants to be Governor of California?

1024
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:35,520
I won another twenty-one thousand.

1025
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,589
Um, that was great.

1026
00:42:37,623 --> 00:42:39,190
Um, I guess the most in the year would probably

1027
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,026
be around 300 thousand.

1028
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,193
I mean I don't think I thought I was set for life

1029
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,029
I always used to joke with everyone that um,

1030
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,865
I'm either going to, just make a lot of money

1031
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,868
or I might worst case scenario I'll marry a rich person.

1032
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,136
That's what I always said.

1033
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:54,239
(nervous chuckling)

1034
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,074
No one comes into this business

1035
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:58,644
to wanna be normal on the back end of it.

1036
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:00,078
Nobody thinks that it's gonna end.

1037
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:03,649
You jump on a merry-go-round you hope the ride never ends.

1038
00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:05,884
I don't think many of them can spell the word future.

1039
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,986
I don't think they did this as a short term investment

1040
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:10,822
in their own future, but they burned out.

1041
00:43:10,856 --> 00:43:12,057
Hookers are hookers.

1042
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,160
I mean hookers are people who are looking for a quick buck

1043
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:18,596
with the least amount of effort so they turn tricks.

1044
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,166
And, uh, being a porn star is just like,

1045
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,269
uh, you know the, the world's oldest profession

1046
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:29,741
so, it's, it's not that complicated,

1047
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:31,777
uh, reality is hard.

1048
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:34,680
A lot of people blame, blame the industry for their problems

1049
00:43:34,713 --> 00:43:37,683
but, uh, then they get out in the real world and find,

1050
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:39,851
lots of problems in the real world too.

1051
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:46,958
I grew up in Pensilvania, um, in the steel-mill towns.

1052
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:49,127
Worked in the steel-mills, I drove cabs,

1053
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,930
it was sorta typical things, uh, people do.

1054
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,933
There I did some illustrations for magazines,

1055
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:58,770
in New York and eventually, started playing uh, music.

1056
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:00,305
Did that for a while.

1057
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:03,108
And then I came out to California

1058
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,710
and end up getting into dirty movies.

1059
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:06,644
(laughing) Just met some people.

1060
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:09,981
Actually I was gonna do a uh, a photo spread,

1061
00:44:10,015 --> 00:44:11,850
I was gonna do some photography of some girls

1062
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:13,284
who were in the business.

1063
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:14,986
I had an idea I would do a photo shoot of them

1064
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,822
and then a little interview.

1065
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:19,657
And, some people I knew from illustrating magazines

1066
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:21,326
in New York said yeah, we'll see what you come up with,

1067
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,062
if it's good we'll pay you and everything so I met the--

1068
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:27,632
these two girls, and, before I knew it, uh,

1069
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,702
I was, in the movies! (laughing)

1070
00:44:30,736 --> 00:44:32,971
So that's sorta how that started.

1071
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,305
But you know when I was working it was,

1072
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:36,742
it wasn't like it is today, it was,

1073
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:39,210
I'd maybe work forty days a year and maybe fifteen

1074
00:44:39,244 --> 00:44:41,046
to twenty days were sex days.

1075
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:43,148
And today they work every day of the week.

1076
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:45,050
Maybe twice a day.

1077
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:47,652
You know, viagra shootin' up their cocks and stuff like that

1078
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:51,156
I mean it's just they're ruining their sex life

1079
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,759
for the rest of their lives, I'm telling ya!

1080
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:55,326
I just think there's too much going on,

1081
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,996
I mean just your personal appetite of it.

1082
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,331
I mean, if you're working as a performer

1083
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:03,668
and you're working that much I mean, sex loses it's mystery

1084
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,337
in it's sense and it's, I mean I remember being turned on

1085
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:08,673
to a point some times, certain situations

1086
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,375
where I would actually shake.

1087
00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:12,677
I mean I'm sure everybody's been in that situation

1088
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,046
and now that, I hate to see that go away.

1089
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,950
I remember one time my dad picked me up from the airport,

1090
00:45:18,984 --> 00:45:21,219
and I was coming in for the holidays and he's, and he-

1091
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:24,389
I had, my pictures were in Hustler magazine eh,

1092
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:29,127
they were on, about a movie and, and I think I was

1093
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,729
(laughing) I was giving some girl head!

1094
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:37,235
And my father says, "I saw that picture in Hustler."

1095
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:42,040
I said uh, yeah, picture, that, wasn't so good of a picture.

1096
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,876
And that's all was said! (laughing)

1097
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:47,045
They never wa-- It was not something

1098
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,280
I wanted to expose them to because it wa--

1099
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:52,083
you know it it, it's embarrassing for them.

1100
00:45:52,117 --> 00:45:54,219
We were so proud of what we did in some of these movies

1101
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:57,956
we did that were-- that were, that got really big play,

1102
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:59,757
that I actually took her to screenings.

1103
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:02,227
We had these screenings in these theaters.

1104
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,329
And I'm taking my wife there watching me have sex

1105
00:46:04,362 --> 00:46:08,066
with these people. And, she was,

1106
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:12,303
it was difficult for her but, she appreciated

1107
00:46:12,337 --> 00:46:15,740
the work we were doing, but after one or two times

1108
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,909
it was like-- or we did that, I said

1109
00:46:17,943 --> 00:46:19,410
hey we don't do this no more!

1110
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,913
She didn't wanna see any pictures of me or anything.

1111
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:24,015
Although she understood what I was doing and knew

1112
00:46:24,049 --> 00:46:27,986
it was the thing that was not gonna be, a situation.

1113
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,155
Can I ask you something?

1114
00:46:30,188 --> 00:46:32,357
Those cops, they're hung pretty good, huh?

1115
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:35,493
Bet they ain't got what I got.

1116
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:41,299
Nobody's got what I got.

1117
00:46:42,968 --> 00:46:46,104
So, yeah, I'd like to retire and paint.

1118
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,939
If I had a game plan.

1119
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:50,141
I saved some money but I wasn't that good.

1120
00:46:50,175 --> 00:46:50,942
No...

1121
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:52,810
I didn't make that much money though.

1122
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:53,778
Come on, what'd I make?

1123
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,280
I mean I, didn't work that much.

1124
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:56,281
You talking about when you were acting?

1125
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:57,448
Save money when he was acting?!

1126
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:58,950
He just didn't have any bills.

1127
00:46:58,984 --> 00:47:00,451
I didn't have any bills. See I told you

1128
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:01,819
I didn't have any bills--

1129
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,122
And then he got me! Ha ha--

1130
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,056
Then she showed up!

1131
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:06,791
I'm a high maintenance, baby.

1132
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:07,825
Then she showed up...

1133
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:12,163
Even if it's not particularly glamourous that day,

1134
00:47:12,197 --> 00:47:16,134
you go to work and you get fussed over,

1135
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:18,803
and if it's a big enough production there's

1136
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:22,407
a makeup artist there, and there's, and there's attention,

1137
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,143
for people who like attention, um,

1138
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:28,813
and then they get paid! The very same day!

1139
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:29,915
Woohoo!

1140
00:47:29,948 --> 00:47:32,483
Now, my great friend Lee Carol once said

1141
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:35,153
as long as you got a cunt, you'll never starve.

1142
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:40,191
But, as a danger to that, because, it wears on your mind.

1143
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,561
My parents didn't take, really an interest in my life

1144
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:46,497
and I was also sexually abused at nine-years-old.

1145
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:50,936
I had a teenaged boy and his sister who was my classmate

1146
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:54,239
introduce me to sexuality and uh,

1147
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:57,408
for the first time in my life and it horrified me.

1148
00:47:57,442 --> 00:47:59,410
Yeah, as soon as I barely graduated high school,

1149
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:01,846
which, I had to cheat my way through,

1150
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,881
my dad ended up coming to me and saying listen,

1151
00:48:03,915 --> 00:48:05,550
you're outta the house, and literally kicked me out

1152
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:07,285
on the street with no food, no money.

1153
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:10,088
And so I'm literally sitting out on the curb,

1154
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:13,391
on Sherman Way, that big tough rebellious teenager

1155
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:15,026
was balling her eyes out.

1156
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:18,896
And all of a sudden, this um, beautiful black man

1157
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:22,100
came over to me and says, are you alright?

1158
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:25,903
What's wrong, why are you crying sweetheart?

1159
00:48:25,937 --> 00:48:27,538
"I have no money and I have no food

1160
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:29,274
and my dad kicked me out."

1161
00:48:29,307 --> 00:48:32,543
He put his arm around me and I- I still to this day

1162
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:35,380
can tell you what that embrace felt like,

1163
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:38,049
and he just said baby I can help you

1164
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:42,220
and I thought Jesus has come to rescue me.

1165
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:45,490
You know I really thought he was gonna help me.

1166
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:48,059
And he said there's a man in the apartment complex

1167
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:50,261
who would love to make love to you.

1168
00:48:50,295 --> 00:48:51,262
He lured me in.

1169
00:48:51,296 --> 00:48:53,498
I went-- You mean have sex?!

1170
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:55,566
He goes yes, but he's really gentle,

1171
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,004
really nice, and you'll get $35.

1172
00:48:59,037 --> 00:49:01,506
So, here I am a single mother,

1173
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:03,908
I've done prostitution and stripping,

1174
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,144
now for six years I've had, uh,

1175
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:10,448
I've been at gunpoint, I've had stalkers try and kill me,

1176
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:13,518
cops try and bust me, I mean I've been in the mafia

1177
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:15,920
basically for six years.

1178
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:20,591
So, someone came to me says, girl, why don't you do porn?

1179
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,593
I said porn? What's that?

1180
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:25,963
It was a lot worse than prostitution, like,

1181
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:27,432
there's a whole crew around,

1182
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,167
they're all stroking themselves going--

1183
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,370
It was just totally degrading and I went oh my gosh

1184
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:34,639
this is bad, this is really bad.

1185
00:49:34,672 --> 00:49:36,307
And then all of a sudden like,

1186
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:40,178
I can't explain it but all the rage I ever felt from,

1187
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:44,615
what my parents did, from childhood, from like,

1188
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:47,452
all the things that men abused me with in prostitution

1189
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:51,156
I just like, let it out, on the screen.

1190
00:49:51,189 --> 00:49:55,293
He just said roll it and it's like here I am the newbie

1191
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,962
but I like, took over the entire scene, it was weird.

1192
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:58,963
I just went- Rrrraw!

1193
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:04,302
I'm Roxy! The porn star! Like I was pissed!

1194
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:08,973
But at the end of the scene it just ended and I had um,

1195
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,376
bodily fluids on my face, and they just kinda went

1196
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:13,678
here's a rag and they just threw it and me

1197
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:17,048
and I just grabbed the rag and went.

1198
00:50:17,082 --> 00:50:18,483
And I didn't want them to see me cry,

1199
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,985
so I just kinda turned my face and I was like,

1200
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,488
oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, don't cry,

1201
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:25,323
Shelley, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

1202
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:29,360
Then now all of a sudden I'm involved doing like anal, um,

1203
00:50:29,394 --> 00:50:31,529
gang-bangs with five or six different performers

1204
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:32,730
and I'm thinking oh my god.

1205
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:35,366
Now I'm bringing big jugs of vodka!

1206
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,168
And everyone's egging you on telling you

1207
00:50:37,202 --> 00:50:40,037
no, girl we love you, we're your family now,

1208
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:42,073
you're awesome, and then, and there is

1209
00:50:42,107 --> 00:50:43,674
a family atmosphere that they offer.

1210
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,710
Porn star karaoke, everybody hangs out

1211
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:48,045
at the same parties, wooooo!

1212
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,247
Girl, I love you!

1213
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,082
Everyone's very affectionate, and the reason why

1214
00:50:51,116 --> 00:50:54,119
they're so affectionate is because that's their family.

1215
00:50:54,152 --> 00:50:56,554
Um, they're out, especially in my day, we're outcasts.

1216
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:59,724
In fact I still have scars from suicide attempts.

1217
00:50:59,757 --> 00:51:01,426
And I--

1218
00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:03,261
I said I don't care, I don't wanna live anymore.

1219
00:51:03,294 --> 00:51:07,198
And I took like thirty prescription pills, and uh,

1220
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:10,535
I didn't die, but I knew I wanted out, bad,

1221
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,537
and I remember crying to God,

1222
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,039
drunk off my ass on Jack Daniels,

1223
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,608
thinking if you get me outta this I'll serve you

1224
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:20,245
with my whole life, I swear to god I'll do whatever you want!

1225
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:21,512
Just get me outta this.

1226
00:51:22,313 --> 00:51:23,748
I mean, people who are well adjusted

1227
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:27,051
and have good life skills and who are doing something

1228
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,454
meaningful and constructive with their lives,

1229
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:32,123
they're not in the industry to begin with so,

1230
00:51:32,157 --> 00:51:34,225
the people who are in the industry are really broken

1231
00:51:34,259 --> 00:51:37,562
twisted souls without a lot of great job skills

1232
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:40,398
and uh, you know they're turbulent souls.

1233
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:42,233
So, they're always gonna be

1234
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:44,169
twisting and turning in the wind.

1235
00:51:44,502 --> 00:51:46,137
We'd spent a lot of time in church.

1236
00:51:46,171 --> 00:51:49,440
I actually convinced my mom to send me to Christian School

1237
00:51:49,474 --> 00:51:53,744
when I was 14, she found a way to gather up the funds,

1238
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:59,083
and I went and I was very involved in my church,

1239
00:51:59,116 --> 00:51:59,850
without her.

1240
00:51:59,884 --> 00:52:01,519
You know, it was just, it was me

1241
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:03,321
and my friends and that was how

1242
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:05,423
I grew up and you know,

1243
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:08,092
that all changed when I was sixteen.

1244
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,093
(laughing)

1245
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,661
I spent the night at a girlfriend's house,

1246
00:52:10,695 --> 00:52:14,465
and she, was a teenaged mom, and married,

1247
00:52:14,499 --> 00:52:19,103
and her husband, drugged me. With acid.

1248
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,805
And I-- At that time I had,

1249
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:22,473
I hadn't even stayed up past ten.

1250
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:25,109
So, uh, I didn't, I wasn't really well versed

1251
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,444
in the drug world.

1252
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,180
And that changed everything for me.

1253
00:52:29,214 --> 00:52:31,482
I did the best I could to graduate high school

1254
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:33,618
as fast as I could and, and move out.

1255
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,453
I was outta the house by seventeen.

1256
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:37,322
I knew some people in the adult industry

1257
00:52:37,355 --> 00:52:39,657
and I hung out with them and I'm still friends with them now,

1258
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,459
I don't blame them for hanging out with me

1259
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:43,828
when I was young cause they were young too, so--

1260
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:44,829
(laughing)

1261
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:48,599
Met a few porn stars, and, just--

1262
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,401
Fell in love with them.

1263
00:52:50,435 --> 00:52:54,239
I hung out with them until I was over eighteen,

1264
00:52:54,272 --> 00:52:57,342
did my first movie, and, you know,

1265
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:58,509
it was on from there.

1266
00:52:58,543 --> 00:53:01,879
Well, the first year that I was in the adult industry,

1267
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:04,715
and was doing movies I worked for every company

1268
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:05,983
under the sun.

1269
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,419
You know the dirtiest of the dirtiest kinds of companies,

1270
00:53:08,453 --> 00:53:10,821
that do crazy stuff.

1271
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:15,526
I worked for anybody, I could, to make a buck.

1272
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,863
I told my mom and she flipped out.

1273
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:22,433
She wasn't happy about it but eventually when I,

1274
00:53:22,467 --> 00:53:24,902
you know, formed a career, and I signed with Vivid,

1275
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:26,837
and the pictures were prettier,

1276
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:32,577
and the footage was less disgusting, ha ha ha ha!

1277
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:36,414
Um, she came to terms and you know, what's she gonna do?

1278
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:37,648
It is what it is.

1279
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:42,253
Being a Vivid girl is, you know,

1280
00:53:42,287 --> 00:53:45,890
it's what every adult industry actress wants to be.

1281
00:53:45,923 --> 00:53:48,793
You know Vivid's the biggest best

1282
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:51,696
and most well-known company in the world.

1283
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:52,763
They have the most beautiful girls,

1284
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:54,231
they have the best photographers.

1285
00:53:54,265 --> 00:53:57,302
Um, they have the best press.

1286
00:53:57,335 --> 00:54:00,405
And, (deep breath), it's yeah, it's,

1287
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:02,573
it's a high class slew of girls.

1288
00:54:02,607 --> 00:54:04,709
I would think-- I mean, of course you know,

1289
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:05,776
it's as high class as it's gonna get.

1290
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:07,612
(laughing)

1291
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:11,215
Um, it's a steady income, so I don't know if

1292
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,918
I necessarily thought I was better than anybody else,

1293
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:17,221
but I knew I was getting the press that I wanted,

1294
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:20,758
so, I was happy. You know.

1295
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:23,461
I took my movies very seriously.

1296
00:54:23,494 --> 00:54:24,962
I studied my scripts.

1297
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:27,732
Half the time I wasn't stoned,

1298
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,335
when I did the dialogue, but I took my acting

1299
00:54:30,368 --> 00:54:32,236
very seriously because it was the only time

1300
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,738
I was ever gonna get to do any acting.

1301
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:37,908
So, I took it seriously! And I loved it!

1302
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:42,813
And um, I thought I was good at it but, you know--

1303
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:45,516
It just sounds so cliche for me to say

1304
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:48,586
I took the acting in my porno movie seriously.

1305
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:49,754
But, but I did.

1306
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:53,458
And that was my favorite part, was the acting.

1307
00:54:55,526 --> 00:54:56,827
And sometimes the sex.

1308
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,729
(laughing)

1309
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:02,867
You can use drugs and party and drink,

1310
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:06,437
no matter what career choice you have, but,

1311
00:55:06,471 --> 00:55:09,374
(deep breath), yes, you're opened up

1312
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:11,809
to the party lifestyle a lot more.

1313
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:13,511
I mean, you hang out with rockstars, you,

1314
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:17,715
you know there's always porn parties to go to, um--

1315
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:24,489
Me, struggling as an addict, of course took advantage

1316
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:26,023
of everything that was there, you know,

1317
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:27,992
all of the alcohol, all of--

1318
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:30,294
all of the drugs, I did 'em all!

1319
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,996
(laughing)

1320
00:55:32,497 --> 00:55:33,464
Um--

1321
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:36,300
It's not a safe business to be in

1322
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,602
if you wanna stay clean.

1323
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:40,337
It's not safe.

1324
00:55:41,572 --> 00:55:43,340
Um, and I'm not telling you this

1325
00:55:43,374 --> 00:55:44,809
to make you feel sorry for me or anything

1326
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,644
but I had an extremely tough childhood,

1327
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:49,847
and um, I think I got very lost for many years.

1328
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,350
Um, I didn't know who I was, like many people.

1329
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:59,590
Um, I had a very warped understanding of what love was.

1330
00:55:59,624 --> 00:56:04,495
And um, I think because of a lack of love in my life or a,

1331
00:56:04,529 --> 00:56:07,498
an inability to determine what love really is

1332
00:56:07,532 --> 00:56:11,669
I saw sexual attention, as love.

1333
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:13,904
And when you've suffered a lot of sexual abuse in your life

1334
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:16,607
it's understandable I think why you would feel that way.

1335
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:19,710
Trying to tell you...

1336
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:21,679
at what point I made the decision

1337
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:24,515
to be Tiffany Million is not something I could answer

1338
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:26,884
really in just one neat sentence.

1339
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:28,919
It's kind of a combination of things.

1340
00:56:29,954 --> 00:56:33,758
Essentially the whole reason that I even got into

1341
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,560
that business to begin with was because I was

1342
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:40,030
a single mother, like many people, and um,

1343
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:44,469
I was living in Southern California, I had no family,

1344
00:56:44,502 --> 00:56:46,070
I didn't know that many people,

1345
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:47,738
her father wasn't helping me with her,

1346
00:56:47,772 --> 00:56:50,641
and it was pretty scary being a single parent honestly,

1347
00:56:50,675 --> 00:56:52,877
and so, I mean I figured, you know

1348
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,880
I had a choice: I could work eight hours a day,

1349
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,883
and commute an hour or two each way on the freeway,

1350
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:01,486
to make, seven eight dollars an hour,

1351
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:04,054
only to pay out half of that in taxes,

1352
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:06,891
and child care, and my daughter's with you know

1353
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:08,926
heaven knows who during the day,

1354
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:12,396
or I could re-enter the adult entertainment industry

1355
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,565
'cause I'd been a stripper years before.

1356
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:16,734
And then I thought, cause I'd always been kind of a fan

1357
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,403
of adult films, and I'd so many times I had looked

1358
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,939
at those movies and uh, I'd thought man,

1359
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:24,675
you know what I could do that and I could do it better.

1360
00:57:24,709 --> 00:57:27,077
You know. And so I thought well heck, why not?

1361
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:28,913
I mean I didn't have a man in my life anymore,

1362
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:32,416
I left her father, and uh, I definitely needed the money,

1363
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,952
but really it just afforded me a way to,

1364
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:38,088
work as little as possible to get as much money as I could

1365
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:39,757
to be with my daughter cause that's all

1366
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:43,093
I really wanted I wanted my daughter to have a great life,

1367
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:44,995
and a safe home, in a good neighborhood,

1368
00:57:45,029 --> 00:57:46,597
with good childcare, and I wanted

1369
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:48,132
to spend as much time with her as I could.

1370
00:57:48,165 --> 00:57:50,935
And working in the adult film industry allowed me

1371
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:54,438
to work a day or two a week and be with my daughter

1372
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,840
the rest of the week and make more money

1373
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:57,174
than people than worked, you know,

1374
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:59,443
five days a week, eight hours a day.

1375
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,679
What you do in porn films is not sex.

1376
00:58:01,712 --> 00:58:03,113
I mean I know you're being penetrated,

1377
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:04,615
but it's like this, you know.

1378
00:58:04,649 --> 00:58:05,616
It's like this.

1379
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:06,817
I mean that's what it feels like.

1380
00:58:06,851 --> 00:58:10,888
It's just something occupying um, a chasm in your body.

1381
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:13,023
Really-- It's like this.

1382
00:58:13,057 --> 00:58:15,159
It's like this that's what it might as well be.

1383
00:58:15,192 --> 00:58:16,694
Uh, there uh, there's no emotion there,

1384
00:58:16,727 --> 00:58:18,829
there's no feeling, um, you know,

1385
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:22,166
you know, I gotta tell you this funny little story!

1386
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:23,834
I would have so many fans come up to me

1387
00:58:23,868 --> 00:58:25,636
at autograph signings whatever and tell me that

1388
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:27,504
I was their favorite porn star,

1389
00:58:27,538 --> 00:58:29,139
because all the other girls were faking it

1390
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:30,741
and I was the one that they knew,

1391
00:58:30,775 --> 00:58:33,510
man, that I was for real. (laughing)

1392
00:58:33,544 --> 00:58:35,646
And uh, and I can tell when a woman's faking it

1393
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,181
and I'd be laughing!

1394
00:58:37,782 --> 00:58:40,517
Watch my face. Watch my face.

1395
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:45,222
(screaming)

1396
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:46,991
'Cause I'd be like--

1397
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,726
I'm the biggest damn faker you ever met!

1398
00:58:48,759 --> 00:58:51,528
I mean I'm good, that's why I get paid the big bucks.

1399
00:58:51,562 --> 00:58:53,163
Even when I was in the business,

1400
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:57,034
I didn't partake of all of the extraneous activities.

1401
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:58,869
Um, I think I went to several parties only

1402
00:58:58,903 --> 00:59:00,204
because there was free food and boozes,

1403
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:01,872
and I would go and I would eat and stuff

1404
00:59:01,906 --> 00:59:03,207
and then everybody would go to the after-parties

1405
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,710
and I'd be like nah, I'm going home and going to bed.

1406
00:59:05,743 --> 00:59:06,711
(laughing)

1407
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:08,045
I've always been early to bed, early to rise.

1408
00:59:08,078 --> 00:59:10,748
I never wanted to be a part of that scene and um,

1409
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:12,082
even when I was working in the movies

1410
00:59:12,116 --> 00:59:14,084
I always kinda felt like a fly on the wall.

1411
00:59:14,118 --> 00:59:16,020
Like I know my body was involved,

1412
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,622
because, obviously, I was there.

1413
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:19,724
But I always had this strange feeling

1414
00:59:19,757 --> 00:59:21,025
this real feeling of disconnect.

1415
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,893
Like I was up here looking down.

1416
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:25,630
When my father died in 94, uh like I said

1417
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:27,131
he left me a whole bunch of money,

1418
00:59:27,164 --> 00:59:29,199
and I suddenly realized that I'm free.

1419
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:31,068
I don't have to be her anymore.

1420
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:33,137
And I walked away. And that was it.

1421
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:36,206
No one puts a gun to anybody's head to do this.

1422
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,542
If you're not warned about what's gonna happen

1423
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,144
then the person who didn't warn you is the person who's

1424
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:42,647
guilty in that respect, but they're doing it

1425
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,882
for the one thing that they cannot deny.

1426
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:47,885
That absolute death-wish, for the recognition,

1427
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:49,654
validation, and credibility.

1428
00:59:49,687 --> 00:59:51,822
And they're welcome to it, but eventually

1429
00:59:51,856 --> 00:59:54,892
their past will catch up to them and they have

1430
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,995
to be aware of the fact that X is forever.

1431
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:03,567
When I got into the business, um, I, did have a goal.

1432
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,136
It was my "cracked out" goal. (laughing)

1433
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:09,273
But I did have a goal to, be out,

1434
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:14,078
and retired, twenty-six, at the latest twenty-seven.

1435
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,612
Um--

1436
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:18,683
And I was out, by twenty-four.

1437
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:25,155
I didn't leave the business because uh, I wanted to.

1438
01:00:25,189 --> 01:00:27,324
I left the business cause I felt I HAD to.

1439
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:29,660
That it was the right thing to do.

1440
01:00:29,694 --> 01:00:35,599
On November fourth, 1984, was the first headline,

1441
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,768
in the San Francisco Chronicle,

1442
01:00:37,802 --> 01:00:41,138
regarding the heterosexual transmission of AIDS.

1443
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:44,208
A good friend of mine, who was a mathematician

1444
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:46,610
had read the same article I did and he came over

1445
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,345
to my house in the afternoon and he said

1446
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:51,782
"I've done some calculations based on the numbers,

1447
01:00:51,816 --> 01:00:53,150
reported here in the story.

1448
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:55,720
And you're in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1449
01:00:55,753 --> 01:00:57,855
I want you to stop."

1450
01:00:57,888 --> 01:00:59,656
I had three jobs lined up for December,

1451
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:02,326
my wife said I don't want you to do them.

1452
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:03,961
And my thinking was look, they're just trying

1453
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:06,030
to sell newspapers, that's what newspapers do,

1454
01:01:06,063 --> 01:01:08,899
they scare you, and so I don't think the danger is

1455
01:01:08,933 --> 01:01:11,802
that real, and I'm gonna go ahead and do these jobs.

1456
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:13,337
So I went off and I did the three jobs.

1457
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:16,140
And when I came home, and we're about to go

1458
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:18,675
to bed, that night, she said to me

1459
01:01:18,709 --> 01:01:20,044
"Do you think we should?"

1460
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,048
Should? Should what? Have sex?

1461
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:26,851
"Yeah, do you think we should have sex?"

1462
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:29,653
And I said, what are you talking about?

1463
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,321
And she said, and I can quote you verbatim,

1464
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:32,757
I remembered this all this time.

1465
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:36,660
She said "Don't you think it would be prudent,

1466
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:40,931
if one of us remained alive, to raise the kids?"

1467
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,368
Pchew!

1468
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:47,237
That was the brick wall.

1469
01:01:47,271 --> 01:01:51,175
Somebody had offered me a DVD deal, and I--

1470
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,709
I knew CD-ROMS didn't do good,

1471
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:53,778
I knew the laser disks didn't do good,

1472
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:55,279
and I thought, uh, this DVD thing,

1473
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:59,016
whatever it is, won't replace video, so I signed it

1474
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,851
without having a lawyer look at it or anything,

1475
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:05,756
and by the time DVDs started taking over from videos,

1476
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:07,257
I looked at the contract and found out now

1477
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:11,195
they have my DVD rights, also had internet rights,

1478
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,297
and the company wasn't very good.

1479
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,101
And once I realized I wasn't gonna make much money

1480
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:20,204
I stayed with Evil Angel my distributor,

1481
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:21,772
for as long as I could, then when they stopped

1482
01:02:21,806 --> 01:02:22,940
doing videos that was it.

1483
01:02:22,973 --> 01:02:25,709
The ones that do well, are out because they wanna be out,

1484
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,411
not because they had to get out.

1485
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:31,215
And, they have made their peace with what they did,

1486
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:33,417
and that shows in their bearing,

1487
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:35,752
and the way that they are, in the world.

1488
01:02:36,153 --> 01:02:38,823
The money that I did save up went really quick.

1489
01:02:38,856 --> 01:02:42,893
Um, and then I was just, scraping by.

1490
01:02:42,927 --> 01:02:48,232
And it was, um, it was the Christian community that

1491
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:50,835
really came alongside me and helped me out.

1492
01:02:50,868 --> 01:02:52,069
There would be times when I was,

1493
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:54,071
didn't know how I was gonna pay my rent,

1494
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:58,108
and, somebody, it was just people I don't even know,

1495
01:02:58,142 --> 01:03:01,311
just people who've read my story, who wanted to help.

1496
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,914
When I left the business I sold my house

1497
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:09,954
in Los Angeles, um, I first- I retired, and then,

1498
01:03:09,987 --> 01:03:13,257
um, I decided, I need to get out of L.A.

1499
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,960
I needed to get out of L.A.

1500
01:03:15,993 --> 01:03:20,865
I mean, everywhere I went, McDonalds drive-thru,

1501
01:03:20,898 --> 01:03:25,335
um, nightclubs, the movie theatre, the park,

1502
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:28,772
Universal Studios, I mean, you name it,

1503
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,275
I could not, go anywhere. I mean I don't know

1504
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,277
how these big celebrities deal with it all.

1505
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,278
I mean they must ha--

1506
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:35,412
They have to have bodyguards of course

1507
01:03:35,445 --> 01:03:38,949
and stuff like that cause I did not have bodyguards

1508
01:03:38,983 --> 01:03:41,118
and I could not handle it.

1509
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:44,021
It's impossible to lead a normal life after you get out of it.

1510
01:03:44,054 --> 01:03:46,390
This is forever. This is the scarlet letter.

1511
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:48,792
And it, it never goes away, you'll be dealing with the,

1512
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,896
with the implications of this forever.

1513
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:53,497
What, (sigh),

1514
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:56,500
what tends to happen is that it isolates you.

1515
01:03:56,533 --> 01:04:02,006
And so you, develop a, a fear of,

1516
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:04,141
being rejected again and again and again

1517
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:06,843
and so you put up walls between you and other people,

1518
01:04:06,877 --> 01:04:10,147
and you isolate yourself and you don't join communities,

1519
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:13,017
and, when you're isolated you're less likely

1520
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,151
to suffer rejection.

1521
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:16,386
But you're also isolated and living on the edge

1522
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:19,523
so, um, you can never get away from this,

1523
01:04:19,556 --> 01:04:21,391
there's no solution.

1524
01:04:21,425 --> 01:04:26,196
To go from being uh, a movie star,

1525
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:28,933
to zippo the pinhead overnight,

1526
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:31,868
was just like, devastating to my ego.

1527
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:35,339
If you're looking for a long career in the porn business

1528
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:38,408
you're probably looking in the wrong place.

1529
01:04:38,442 --> 01:04:43,847
Uh, the average girl, might be good for, two years?

1530
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:48,118
Two to three years tops for the average girl.

1531
01:04:48,152 --> 01:04:51,188
If you're lucky and you're one of the few superstars,

1532
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:53,023
not very many of those, okay then you get uh,

1533
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:55,059
you know, six seven years. Eight years.

1534
01:04:55,092 --> 01:04:57,394
And if you play your cards right,

1535
01:04:57,427 --> 01:05:00,264
and do your financial thing right, then you can,

1536
01:05:00,297 --> 01:05:03,067
you know, make some money and set yourself up.

1537
01:05:04,001 --> 01:05:05,535
Overall I guess I'm happy I did it.

1538
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:07,871
I mean the only thing I don't like is that, it,

1539
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,906
the main thing I really wanted to do is act and be

1540
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:13,377
in comedies and tv, and I feel like it holds me back.

1541
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:15,212
But I don't know if I would have just stuck

1542
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:16,880
with the normal route if I would've uh,

1543
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,148
ended up making it to tv at all,

1544
01:05:18,182 --> 01:05:20,050
who knows I'd probably, maybe still be

1545
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:21,585
in Florida going to castings,

1546
01:05:21,618 --> 01:05:23,387
maybe I never would have come out here.

1547
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,222
So, and I've gotten to do a lot of Cinemax movies

1548
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,291
which are really fun too, and all those things

1549
01:05:27,324 --> 01:05:29,926
I've gotten to do because of probably the porn.

1550
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,895
So overall I guess I'm happy I did it.

1551
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,064
Um, uh, part of the reason we're her in Utah is

1552
01:05:34,098 --> 01:05:36,100
because porn is illegal here, so uh,

1553
01:05:36,133 --> 01:05:38,235
it really helps keep me from being recognized.

1554
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:40,470
That and the forty extra pounds I gained!

1555
01:05:40,504 --> 01:05:44,074
But um, now that I'm losing that weight, um,

1556
01:05:44,108 --> 01:05:46,010
well I also cut off my hair so that helps too.

1557
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:47,344
But um.

1558
01:05:47,377 --> 01:05:48,912
Yeah, everyone's been really cool about,

1559
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,081
um, if they find out who I am.

1560
01:05:51,115 --> 01:05:52,449
They've been really good about it.

1561
01:05:52,482 --> 01:05:54,184
When I took Katty to her new daycare

1562
01:05:54,218 --> 01:05:57,521
and they asked, if I had um, reference names for like,

1563
01:05:57,554 --> 01:05:59,123
who to call if something happens to Katty I said

1564
01:05:59,156 --> 01:06:01,025
I don't know anybody here, I have no references, sorry,

1565
01:06:01,058 --> 01:06:02,993
and she thought that was a little bit suspicious,

1566
01:06:03,027 --> 01:06:04,461
and so she looked me up online,

1567
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:08,532
I had given her the name Asia Lemon, um,

1568
01:06:08,565 --> 01:06:10,267
and from that name she managed to figure out

1569
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,668
who I was and so the next day she goes,

1570
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:14,004
uh, you know I did a little Googling on you.

1571
01:06:14,038 --> 01:06:17,274
And I was like Ugh! (nervous laughing)

1572
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:20,377
Miss Mormon Mommy of four who did a little Googling on Asia.

1573
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:22,646
I was like, so, you still gonna watch my kid?

1574
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,616
Well you know, unfortunately like uh,

1575
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:29,319
one of the reasons I like-- the fact that Vince Neal

1576
01:06:29,353 --> 01:06:31,455
has me playing his charity tournament for his daughter

1577
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:33,123
for children's cancer and stuff,

1578
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:34,958
and I played in the Country uh,

1579
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,227
Academy of Country Music Awards charity tournament

1580
01:06:37,261 --> 01:06:39,963
this year and a few other charity tournaments

1581
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:43,367
cause it's one of the only ways, that porn people can give

1582
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:47,537
to charities, unfortunately in this hypocritical world,

1583
01:06:47,571 --> 01:06:49,973
a lot of charities don't want to accept money

1584
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,375
from people that are in the sex business.

1585
01:06:51,408 --> 01:06:54,311
"Eww, the sex business we can't do that."

1586
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,146
Politicians, on the other hand,

1587
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,182
who make us look clean as hell,

1588
01:06:58,215 --> 01:06:59,383
no problem taking their money.

1589
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:02,052
Uh, unscrupulous business men

1590
01:07:02,086 --> 01:07:03,520
who's ripping everybody off, no problem!

1591
01:07:03,553 --> 01:07:05,989
But because we have a little sex once in a while,

1592
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:09,393
naw, can't do you and that pissed me off.

1593
01:07:09,426 --> 01:07:11,495
I had one interesting moment in baseball

1594
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:12,496
with my son in little league.

1595
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:14,664
I had told nobody about my career,

1596
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:19,236
and uh, one day the manager, who was this big black guy

1597
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:22,206
who was a Stanford graduate, he comes up to me

1598
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:26,176
and he goes, "Gonna be some trouble today."

1599
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:27,277
And I said what do you mean?

1600
01:07:27,311 --> 01:07:30,013
He says, "One of the mothers knows who's you are."

1601
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,682
He looks at me and he's says "You know I knew

1602
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:34,684
who you were the minute you came on the field."

1603
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:35,685
And he said I'll tell you the truth.

1604
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:37,354
He said "Anybody that's been

1605
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:39,689
in Nina Hartly's booty is okay with me."

1606
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:42,526
(laughing) He says

1607
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,761
"I will take care of this." And he did.

1608
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:46,530
MENSA's a high IQ society.

1609
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:50,700
You have to have an IQ in the top two percent, to get in.

1610
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:54,238
I got in, with a notarized copy of my SAT scores.

1611
01:07:54,271 --> 01:07:56,306
MENSA didn't want link to my website even though

1612
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:58,208
they linked all the member's websites,

1613
01:07:58,242 --> 01:08:00,210
because uh, of who I was, and adult star,

1614
01:08:00,244 --> 01:08:03,247
um, so, that was their excuse,

1615
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,383
and so I made them a special little webpage of Asia

1616
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:09,319
just like, happy Asia, college pictures and smiling Asia

1617
01:08:09,353 --> 01:08:11,721
and, just innocent stuff and it's two pages,

1618
01:08:11,755 --> 01:08:14,558
and that's, so that's where MENSA links to now,

1619
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:16,226
instead of my regular site.

1620
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:17,627
And they finally acknowledged me

1621
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:20,564
in their MENSA celebrity issue which was,

1622
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:23,099
a really big moment for me. That was cool.

1623
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:25,402
Wait, how do you say it?

1624
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:26,102
(inaudible) Unprecedented?

1625
01:08:26,136 --> 01:08:27,171
Unprecedented? It sounds weird.

1626
01:08:27,204 --> 01:08:28,172
Okay. (laughing)

1627
01:08:28,205 --> 01:08:31,641
I've done something unprecedented that

1628
01:08:31,675 --> 01:08:34,077
nobody else in, the adult industry has ever done.

1629
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,579
Um, and that was you know running

1630
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:38,415
for Governor of California, actually two times.

1631
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:41,518
And um, it was amazing, when I first started out,

1632
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:43,753
the owner of my company and I thought that

1633
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:45,255
it was gonna be just like a little fun joke,

1634
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:46,356
see if I could get some press,

1635
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:48,425
maybe get on the van.com, so when I went down

1636
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:50,194
to the courthouse to get my paperwork when we said

1637
01:08:50,227 --> 01:08:52,462
I was gonna do it, um, Howard Stern Show

1638
01:08:52,496 --> 01:08:55,432
sent a camera crew down, Channel 7, Channel 5,

1639
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:56,600
all the news shows showed up,

1640
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,835
Associated Press, writers, and that's when him

1641
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:00,804
and I are like Okay, I gotta get on that ballot

1642
01:09:00,837 --> 01:09:02,339
because this is gonna be huge.

1643
01:09:02,372 --> 01:09:04,107
I'm going to get rid of the car tax and

1644
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,176
put a tax on breast implants instead.

1645
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:07,644
I will legalize gay marriage.

1646
01:09:07,677 --> 01:09:09,779
And I will make sure everyone who files

1647
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:11,648
for unemployment gets jury duty.

1648
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:14,618
In other words, California, I'll be a kickass governor,

1649
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:17,454
so vote for me, Mary Carey, on October 7th.

1650
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:20,557
I mean, of course, some of my platforms were very

1651
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:23,193
tongue in cheek, and funny but, you know,

1652
01:09:23,227 --> 01:09:24,861
when I was getting towards the end of it

1653
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:26,663
I realized that you know I really wanted

1654
01:09:26,696 --> 01:09:28,798
to make a difference and I felt like I really was

1655
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:31,134
making a difference because I was getting a lot

1656
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,836
of people who normally wouldn't follow politics

1657
01:09:32,869 --> 01:09:36,373
to follow, because of me. And um, you know,

1658
01:09:36,406 --> 01:09:37,507
and then I was like what if I win?

1659
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:38,808
(laughing) But, you know,

1660
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:40,644
coming in tenth place is pretty amazing

1661
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:42,178
out of a hundred and thirty-two people.

1662
01:09:42,212 --> 01:09:44,314
When I was eighteen years old, um,

1663
01:09:44,348 --> 01:09:46,750
I went to uh, real-estate school, just everything

1664
01:09:46,783 --> 01:09:48,718
about real-estate just I really liked,

1665
01:09:48,752 --> 01:09:52,522
so I figured that I would always, do something with that.

1666
01:09:52,556 --> 01:09:55,158
I was working for a builder, uh, a,

1667
01:09:55,191 --> 01:10:00,230
a home builder, here, and, corporate,

1668
01:10:00,264 --> 01:10:03,533
came to my community and shut the doors

1669
01:10:03,567 --> 01:10:04,734
and said we need to talk to you.

1670
01:10:04,768 --> 01:10:09,339
Someone recognized you, We know who you are,

1671
01:10:09,373 --> 01:10:12,542
and you are too recognizable and it's a,

1672
01:10:12,576 --> 01:10:15,178
we're too conservative of a company,

1673
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,213
and we're gonna have to let you go.

1674
01:10:18,415 --> 01:10:20,183
And so that was right before,

1675
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:23,253
that was a week before I got diagnosed with cancer.

1676
01:10:23,287 --> 01:10:25,188
And the ones that got out of this business

1677
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,458
and now are being blighted by the society that

1678
01:10:28,492 --> 01:10:29,759
jacked off to them.

1679
01:10:29,793 --> 01:10:32,462
Well the society are the ones that's guilty for that.

1680
01:10:32,496 --> 01:10:33,763
They're damning them for something that

1681
01:10:33,797 --> 01:10:35,432
gave them pleasure, but they refuse

1682
01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:37,200
to admit that they got the pleasure from them.

1683
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,703
and that's a very very sad state of affairs.

1684
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:41,871
Now I was starting to direct,

1685
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:46,476
and I was hired, uh, a couple months later,

1686
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:47,711
to go to Germany to work.

1687
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:50,947
I'd make about eight grand or something like that.

1688
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,282
Work eight days or something.

1689
01:10:52,316 --> 01:10:54,884
And I didn't wanna do this any more at this time,

1690
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:56,553
I didn't wanna do it any more.

1691
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:59,389
So I left, said goodbye to her, stood in line

1692
01:10:59,423 --> 01:11:01,891
two hours, and as I'm going I'm saying I don't wanna go,

1693
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:02,959
I'm saying to myself I don't wanna go,

1694
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:04,661
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna--

1695
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:06,463
And it just built up and built up until I got,

1696
01:11:06,496 --> 01:11:09,733
finally got to the point of where,

1697
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:10,734
"May I help you?"

1698
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,969
they said, you know, ticket counter,

1699
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:15,672
I said uh, no, I'm not going.

1700
01:11:15,705 --> 01:11:18,775
(laughing) I took my bags, I call up Kathleen

1701
01:11:18,808 --> 01:11:20,276
and I said baby I'm coming home,

1702
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:22,646
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go to Europe.

1703
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:24,414
I'm thinking about the trip and everything,

1704
01:11:24,448 --> 01:11:27,250
I don't wanna do this, I wanna stay home with her.

1705
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,586
So, that was pretty much the last thing I did.

1706
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:31,755
Really what got me out of it was my husband.

1707
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:36,593
Because, when I met Ron, he had no idea

1708
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:39,996
who I used to be. Ron loved me, for me.

1709
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:42,699
And you know he could had a much younger woman,

1710
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:44,534
he could had a much better looking woman,

1711
01:11:44,568 --> 01:11:46,536
he could had a woman with a lot more money.

1712
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:48,338
But he fell in love with me.

1713
01:11:48,372 --> 01:11:49,939
He didn't know anything about that part of me.

1714
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:52,709
And the fact that he accepted me for who I was

1715
01:11:52,742 --> 01:11:54,711
and loved me for who I was--

1716
01:11:57,381 --> 01:11:58,848
Taught me how to love me.

1717
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:00,550
Really.

1718
01:12:00,584 --> 01:12:03,887
And his love for me has reconnected me

1719
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,390
with the person that I was before I EVER,

1720
01:12:06,423 --> 01:12:07,657
did any of this crap.

1721
01:12:08,725 --> 01:12:13,329
All of a sudden Mr. Right came into my life, and I hated him.

1722
01:12:13,363 --> 01:12:15,365
Ha! When I first met him.

1723
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:17,000
His whole life he was raised in Christian school

1724
01:12:17,033 --> 01:12:19,836
from like, he went to the same school, the same kids

1725
01:12:19,869 --> 01:12:21,638
from like kindergarten to like twelfth grade.

1726
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:24,808
He was like most valuable player, he did sports,

1727
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:26,342
his mom had all these trophies.

1728
01:12:26,376 --> 01:12:27,477
She has a book this thick

1729
01:12:27,511 --> 01:12:29,479
just on newspaper clippings on him.

1730
01:12:29,513 --> 01:12:31,815
So I was like jealous already I hated his guts.

1731
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:34,484
He would like knock on my door and I would answer

1732
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:35,485
and go, what do you want?

1733
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:36,820
and he goes "I'm here to clean your house."

1734
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:39,322
And I'd be like, what are you doing?

1735
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,490
He goes "You're filthy."

1736
01:12:40,524 --> 01:12:41,491
Ha!

1737
01:12:41,525 --> 01:12:43,393
Like, cause I didn't cook, and I didn't clean

1738
01:12:43,427 --> 01:12:46,362
and I was, and I was, I was falling apart.

1739
01:12:46,396 --> 01:12:48,498
So he literally cleaned my whole house.

1740
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:51,935
With rags for me, and um, I just stopped working.

1741
01:12:51,968 --> 01:12:54,003
didn't wanna prostitute anymore and lie anymore

1742
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:56,039
and we just hit it off and the next thing you know

1743
01:12:56,072 --> 01:12:58,341
we're snorting meth, and next thing you know

1744
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,509
we're reading the bible together.

1745
01:12:59,543 --> 01:13:01,778
And we're like (sniff) dude!

1746
01:13:01,811 --> 01:13:04,581
Did you see like how like God used Joshua like

1747
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:06,516
to conquer all those cities dude.

1748
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:08,752
And he'd be like (sniff) yeah and (inaudible)--

1749
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:11,421
and like I, I mean we're were just like so into the Bible!

1750
01:13:11,455 --> 01:13:14,357
And we realized that he had went to Christian school

1751
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,860
his whole life and was the pastor's son so he had

1752
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:20,730
a really great Christian foundation and,

1753
01:13:20,764 --> 01:13:24,434
I didn't as much as him but, he was so sweet

1754
01:13:24,468 --> 01:13:27,704
and he never once pursued me sexually, so, um,

1755
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:31,441
we ended up getting married on Valentine's Day, 1995.

1756
01:13:31,475 --> 01:13:36,546
I met my husband in a pool, in Hollywood, Florida.

1757
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:39,783
At the Diplomat Hotel. And he was married

1758
01:13:39,816 --> 01:13:43,487
at the time and I had a boyfriend at the time.

1759
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,889
And, he was in the middle of splitting up

1760
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:48,625
and I was kinda done with it.

1761
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:49,626
Little Trist.

1762
01:13:49,659 --> 01:13:52,729
And, I told him I was in the middle of uh,

1763
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:56,099
putting a webpage together, and, he said oh okay,

1764
01:13:56,132 --> 01:13:59,402
and, it had to be maybe three months after

1765
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:03,573
I got my first website up that I got an email from him.

1766
01:14:03,607 --> 01:14:04,908
We went out once, that was it.

1767
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,843
We haven't been apart since.

1768
01:14:06,876 --> 01:14:08,812
Um, my husband died in a car accident

1769
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:10,514
driving home from Las Vegas.

1770
01:14:10,547 --> 01:14:13,583
I had asked him not to do this whole gig actually,

1771
01:14:13,617 --> 01:14:14,851
um, I was eight months pregnant

1772
01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:16,586
and I didn't want him away from me that long,

1773
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,655
and uh, he's like "I gotta do it honey",

1774
01:14:18,688 --> 01:14:20,590
but he tried, he cut it down to two days

1775
01:14:20,624 --> 01:14:22,526
so he was really happy coming home on the second day

1776
01:14:22,559 --> 01:14:23,993
that he was all done with this

1777
01:14:24,027 --> 01:14:26,429
and he came racing home to be with his pregnant wife

1778
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,132
and he flipped the jeep and didn't ever make it home.

1779
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:31,434
Suddenly he's gone and now here I am,

1780
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,436
no more income and all these bills to pay

1781
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,505
and it was just like one thing on top of another.

1782
01:14:35,539 --> 01:14:38,775
And so I, I just, I put up a plea on my website

1783
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:40,677
asking, uh, for donations.

1784
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:42,478
I didn't know what else to do.

1785
01:14:42,512 --> 01:14:43,980
No insurance, no money, bills,

1786
01:14:44,013 --> 01:14:48,785
and my fans donated, enormous amounts of money.

1787
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:50,153
Um, the kids were completely spoiled,

1788
01:14:50,186 --> 01:14:51,821
they got toys and books and presents

1789
01:14:51,855 --> 01:14:54,724
and stuff with pictures on it and just it was,

1790
01:14:54,758 --> 01:14:56,492
unbelievable it would make me cry all the time

1791
01:14:56,526 --> 01:14:57,794
I would open all the mail from all these people

1792
01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,529
I'd never met and it was just, it was

1793
01:14:59,563 --> 01:15:02,131
really wonderful having fans turn out to help me.

1794
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:03,733
Because you know, I'd been online for ten years,

1795
01:15:03,767 --> 01:15:05,001
they'd watched grow up and I'd never asked

1796
01:15:05,034 --> 01:15:06,870
for anything before and here I was I needed help.

1797
01:15:06,903 --> 01:15:08,004
And they helped me.

1798
01:15:08,037 --> 01:15:11,741
I faced those up and, up and downs many times.

1799
01:15:11,775 --> 01:15:14,043
Certainly with my real-estate practice

1800
01:15:14,077 --> 01:15:16,980
and the market and when the market dropped in real-estate,

1801
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,482
and now that the market and, you know,

1802
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:20,917
is dropping all the way across the board

1803
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:22,586
I mean the country is in crisis.

1804
01:15:22,619 --> 01:15:24,487
Our whole country is in crisis.

1805
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,857
It would be really easy for me right now,

1806
01:15:27,891 --> 01:15:32,929
to want to reinvestigate, you know, porn.

1807
01:15:33,797 --> 01:15:34,898
I definitely wanna have kids.

1808
01:15:34,931 --> 01:15:36,900
That's something like, I was actually very depressed

1809
01:15:36,933 --> 01:15:39,202
recently because I, I'm realizing that

1810
01:15:39,235 --> 01:15:40,670
I'm twenty years old and I'm not married

1811
01:15:40,704 --> 01:15:43,039
and I have no kids. And I really want kids.

1812
01:15:43,072 --> 01:15:45,909
And, I'd like to have at least two. Maybe three.

1813
01:15:45,942 --> 01:15:47,844
Because being an only child I always wished

1814
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:48,845
I had a brother or sister.

1815
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:50,113
I still wish I had a brother or sister.

1816
01:15:50,146 --> 01:15:52,181
Like, you know I just, that's something

1817
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:53,216
I've always wanted so.

1818
01:15:54,718 --> 01:15:56,252
I have a gorgeous family.

1819
01:15:57,286 --> 01:15:59,623
My son is amazing. He's my angel.

1820
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:04,694
My daughter is the best thing that ever happened to me.

1821
01:16:04,728 --> 01:16:05,929
She saved my life.

1822
01:16:05,962 --> 01:16:08,131
I want my daughter to have a completely different life.

1823
01:16:08,164 --> 01:16:11,635
I want her to, go to college is number one.

1824
01:16:11,668 --> 01:16:14,704
She's a great student, she's a track star,

1825
01:16:14,738 --> 01:16:18,041
she's had to deal with my porn life.

1826
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:22,812
She, um, hates it. She's embarrassed of it.

1827
01:16:22,846 --> 01:16:25,715
And, um, she won't let me, she doesn't want me

1828
01:16:25,749 --> 01:16:27,583
to go to her track meets, sh--

1829
01:16:27,617 --> 01:16:30,119
because she feels someone would recognize me.

1830
01:16:30,153 --> 01:16:34,791
We're going to church now, I go to church and I um,

1831
01:16:34,824 --> 01:16:39,128
have a strong faith, and I have changed my life

1832
01:16:39,162 --> 01:16:42,666
and I want for her everything that--

1833
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:44,634
I, I don't want her to ever have to experience

1834
01:16:44,668 --> 01:16:45,702
what I experienced.

1835
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:49,105
In the moment? Thank you!

1836
01:16:49,138 --> 01:16:50,674
For being who you are.

1837
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,575
Cause you're a pretty cool dude.

1838
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:53,576
(laughing) Oooo!

1839
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:54,978
Ooo, can I get that in writing?!

1840
01:16:55,011 --> 01:16:57,080
Sure! I can give it to you in writing!

1841
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:57,914
Um.

1842
01:16:57,947 --> 01:16:59,115
You're welcome.

1843
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:01,617
It's interesting.

1844
01:17:01,651 --> 01:17:03,653
I mean, what I'm sitting here thinking is, I wonder

1845
01:17:03,687 --> 01:17:05,855
how many other people out there can have this kind

1846
01:17:05,889 --> 01:17:07,123
of conversation with their parents.

1847
01:17:07,156 --> 01:17:08,692
I mean most people can't sit around and think

1848
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:11,627
about their parents having sex, or, um,

1849
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:13,697
especially fucking somebody other than their mother.

1850
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:14,964
I mean that alone would I think

1851
01:17:14,998 --> 01:17:15,999
irritate a lot of children.

1852
01:17:16,032 --> 01:17:19,268
But, it's very, normalized, in that sex is

1853
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:21,104
a goody that should be enjoyed.

1854
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:23,773
Um, and when you can differentiate between sex

1855
01:17:23,807 --> 01:17:27,143
and love and everything that happens in between,

1856
01:17:27,176 --> 01:17:29,612
um, it's a huge gift that you can give yourself,

1857
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,882
and lovers and partners and friends and family.

1858
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:37,053
And I'm grateful that that's, that's my world.

1859
01:17:38,054 --> 01:17:39,055
Wow.

1860
01:17:40,724 --> 01:17:41,725
I'm impressed.

1861
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:47,797
She, is my role model. She is my hero.

1862
01:17:47,831 --> 01:17:51,200
And, I think I learned a lot from my mom.

1863
01:17:51,234 --> 01:17:54,003
She's gone through a lot and I even tell people that

1864
01:17:54,037 --> 01:17:56,339
she's my hero and she's my role model.

1865
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:58,041
She's just like whatever, I did it for my daughter

1866
01:17:58,074 --> 01:18:00,676
and now she's doing what she wants to she owns

1867
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:03,246
her own business, and no matter how many people

1868
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:04,914
talk down about her she's still does what

1869
01:18:04,948 --> 01:18:06,649
she wants to do and she's successful at it.

1870
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:10,353
So, I guess she's just a good example of,

1871
01:18:10,386 --> 01:18:11,888
don't let other people bring you down,

1872
01:18:11,921 --> 01:18:13,089
just keep doing what you're doing

1873
01:18:13,122 --> 01:18:15,324
and you'll be successful in what you wanna do.

1874
01:18:15,358 --> 01:18:18,161
So. I'm very proud of you! Just so you know that!

1875
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:20,663
Please don't start crying cause then I'll start crying!

1876
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:21,865
I'm not gonna cry!

1877
01:18:22,866 --> 01:18:24,033
I will start crying.

1878
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,836
And since my husband died there wasn't a lot

1879
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:29,873
for me to look forward to so it was kinda nice to have that.

1880
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:32,408
Mom, your husband died?

1881
01:18:33,877 --> 01:18:35,378
(laughing) Daddy. Where's Daddy?

1882
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:37,847
Where's Daddy?

1883
01:18:37,881 --> 01:18:39,048
Up in the clouds.

1884
01:18:39,082 --> 01:18:41,851
There comes a point in our life when family becomes first,

1885
01:18:41,885 --> 01:18:45,021
the first thing and the question, the answer

1886
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:48,691
to the question, it just doesn't even take a beat.

1887
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,960
Sometimes... (unintelligible)

1888
01:18:51,928 --> 01:18:55,698
And we have the opportunity to see our friends and family.

1889
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:58,802
I think Chuck would really appreciate,

1890
01:18:58,835 --> 01:19:00,870
that we're here today.

1891
01:19:00,904 --> 01:19:04,040
There was something uniquely vital about Buck Adams that

1892
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:06,075
could brighten up the darkest moment,

1893
01:19:06,109 --> 01:19:09,112
and put a grin on the face of the bleakest situation.

1894
01:19:09,979 --> 01:19:14,083
With a body that appeared to be hewn from a granite block

1895
01:19:14,117 --> 01:19:17,053
of cement, and an intensity that provided his fans

1896
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:19,989
with a vicarious sustenance, Buck Adams will always be

1897
01:19:20,023 --> 01:19:22,859
remembered as the guy who got it up when it counted.

1898
01:19:24,027 --> 01:19:30,233
You know like I said, if you knew it was gonna happen...

1899
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:31,767
what would you have said?

1900
01:19:33,136 --> 01:19:35,839
And you don't always get that chance.

1901
01:19:37,173 --> 01:19:39,242
Um, but right now, in my life,

1902
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:43,146
I, regret doing porn.

1903
01:19:43,179 --> 01:19:48,151
I regret doing porn and I never thought, ever,

1904
01:19:48,184 --> 01:19:51,988
that I would be, who I became.

1905
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:54,858
Houston.

1906
01:19:54,891 --> 01:19:58,761
I never thought I would be so big and so recognizable

1907
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:01,030
and just, I just never thought that

1908
01:20:01,064 --> 01:20:03,466
it would turn into what it did, for me.

1909
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:06,169
And God just says, Shelley,

1910
01:20:06,202 --> 01:20:08,437
I'm telling you, you need to--

1911
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:09,472
you need to trust me,

1912
01:20:09,505 --> 01:20:11,807
I've got something better for you. I love you.

1913
01:20:11,841 --> 01:20:14,110
I didn't save your ass all these years

1914
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:16,279
not to give you something better.

1915
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:19,883
Well, like, looking back, I didn't,

1916
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:23,987
honestly I can't really like go, on my computer and,

1917
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:26,956
and look at stuff that I used to do anymore

1918
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:29,959
it just makes me, I just, I'm so different.

1919
01:20:29,993 --> 01:20:33,129
I feel so different now like, where I am in life.

1920
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:36,832
It's really hard for me to believe that I was that girl.

1921
01:20:36,866 --> 01:20:40,136
So yes, it has changed me. For the better I believe.

1922
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:43,072
The porn business has afforded me

1923
01:20:43,106 --> 01:20:45,174
a very comfortable life it has allowed me

1924
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:48,144
to educate myself in ways that I probably wouldn't

1925
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:50,379
have been able to do before.

1926
01:20:50,413 --> 01:20:53,983
It's enabled me to travel all over the world and,

1927
01:20:54,017 --> 01:20:56,219
meet new and interesting people.

1928
01:20:56,252 --> 01:21:00,823
And it's allowed me to, have the,

1929
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,825
have the cajones, if you will,

1930
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:04,827
to try new and exciting things that

1931
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,495
I probably wouldn't have done before.

1932
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:08,397
I would have been afraid to do.

1933
01:21:08,431 --> 01:21:11,367
I have no fear, to do anything.

1934
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,170
You know because as people we have to fully

1935
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:16,439
and freely accept ourself for everything we are

1936
01:21:16,472 --> 01:21:18,541
and everything we're not cause if we have compar--

1937
01:21:18,574 --> 01:21:23,346
If we compartmentalize, we're never a whole self.

1938
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:25,581
You know. Especially in like relationships,

1939
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:28,952
we don't get to bring our whole self.

1940
01:21:28,985 --> 01:21:31,554
What I am afraid of the most is because I've lasted

1941
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:34,090
so long and this industry is now heading towards

1942
01:21:34,123 --> 01:21:37,360
its fourth decade of presence on this earth,

1943
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:39,195
that the people who created this business,

1944
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:41,530
the Eric Edwardses, the Jamie Guillesses,

1945
01:21:41,564 --> 01:21:44,533
the John Lesleys, the great pioneers of this business,

1946
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:47,570
are not gonna be with us, forever, and,

1947
01:21:47,603 --> 01:21:50,406
I'd hoped to be around long enough to honor them

1948
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:52,408
but I don't wanna do it fast and furiously

1949
01:21:52,441 --> 01:21:54,978
because when they start to fall by the wayside

1950
01:21:55,011 --> 01:21:56,412
somebody's gonna have to remember them.

1951
01:21:56,445 --> 01:21:59,215
It's based on a line that, "there is no future

1952
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:02,118
if in the present we fail to pay homage to the past."

1953
01:22:02,151 --> 01:22:05,388
But a lot of them are now in their fifties and sixties,

1954
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:08,091
some of them in their seventies, and somebody is

1955
01:22:08,124 --> 01:22:10,559
going to have to be there to tell their stories.

1956
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:13,429
Eventually this woman is gonna like say,

1957
01:22:13,462 --> 01:22:15,164
wwheeeeuuuheehehehuh.

1958
01:22:15,198 --> 01:22:18,401
And then when you're eighty-five and you can't

1959
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:21,104
walk no more and you're in a wheelchair she's gonna say

1960
01:22:21,137 --> 01:22:23,406
"You remember when you wanted to have sex all day?

1961
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:25,308
Yeah, what do you mean, you want what?

1962
01:22:25,341 --> 01:22:25,941
Bap!

1963
01:22:25,975 --> 01:22:27,076
What do you want? Bap!

1964
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:29,412
No no no, now I'm getting back at you."

1965
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:30,579
(chuckling)

1966
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:33,216
I miss many things about the business.

1967
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:40,089
But, I guess the clearest way to say it concisely would be,

1968
01:22:40,123 --> 01:22:42,091
the biblical phrase occurs to me,

1969
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:44,493
"when I was a child I spake as a child,

1970
01:22:44,527 --> 01:22:47,630
and when I was a man, I put away childish things."

1971
01:22:48,131 --> 01:22:50,499
I'm trying to think of like Joe Nameth.

1972
01:22:50,533 --> 01:22:52,435
Joe, do you miss football?

1973
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:53,436
Sure he does.

1974
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:56,005
But he can't play like he used to play.

1975
01:22:56,039 --> 01:22:59,275
He's, sixty-five years old now.

1976
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:00,609
I'm in the same place.

1977
01:23:00,643 --> 01:23:02,611
Am I happy I did porn? Uh, yeah,

1978
01:23:02,645 --> 01:23:05,281
I really don't have too many regrets cause I,

1979
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:07,950
it's so much stuff came out of it that was positive.

1980
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:10,686
I got to travel around the world, uh,

1981
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:13,389
I met a lot of interesting people,

1982
01:23:13,422 --> 01:23:15,358
I'm way over my quota sexually,

1983
01:23:15,391 --> 01:23:17,626
uh, I think uh, people ask me and I,

1984
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,562
I guess the estimate's, I've been with like,

1985
01:23:19,595 --> 01:23:21,530
three-thousand women or something like that,

1986
01:23:21,564 --> 01:23:23,632
most of them were awesome to work with,

1987
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:28,003
um, still friends with a lot of 'em, so uh,

1988
01:23:28,037 --> 01:23:30,005
yeah, overall it was a hell of an experience.

1989
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:32,075
Essentially I am living my life right now

1990
01:23:32,108 --> 01:23:34,643
the way I wanna live it for the rest of my life

1991
01:23:34,677 --> 01:23:37,380
and I wanna, I wanna die doing what I'm doing right now.

1992
01:23:37,413 --> 01:23:38,981
How many people can say that?

1993
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:41,317
Well I am, that I live here and I have a place

1994
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,352
that I love this much I think I'm as lucky

1995
01:23:43,386 --> 01:23:44,987
as anybody could be on earth.

1996
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,356
Far as, I mean, I dunno what the hell t'ask for.

1997
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:50,193
I'm happy.

1998
01:23:51,194 --> 01:23:52,595
I'm not in a dark place,

1999
01:23:52,628 --> 01:23:56,999
I'm not suicidal, I'm not doing drugs.

2000
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:59,668
You know I'm not self-destructive.

2001
01:23:59,702 --> 01:24:02,004
Um, but the last two years has been a journey,

2002
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,373
cause I was very self-destructive before and,

2003
01:24:04,407 --> 01:24:07,376
I'm not saying it changed overnight,

2004
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:09,412
I still have self-destructive thoughts,

2005
01:24:09,445 --> 01:24:16,252
but, um, I'm just in an, healthier place all around.

2006
01:24:16,752 --> 01:24:19,355
You hear some people we talk to who are leading

2007
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:21,124
normal lives, and are doing pretty good,

2008
01:24:21,157 --> 01:24:22,525
like how the hell would you really know,

2009
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:25,194
like, how would you know what really goes on

2010
01:24:25,228 --> 01:24:26,695
in their life at two a.m.?

2011
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:30,099
The torment, the, you know, how would you know that

2012
01:24:30,133 --> 01:24:31,534
they're gonna tell you about all the times

2013
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:33,536
they've been rejected and isolated and,

2014
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:36,038
and the horror and the shame that,

2015
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:38,241
that their children confront and that,

2016
01:24:38,274 --> 01:24:41,144
their spouses confront, and the shame that

2017
01:24:41,177 --> 01:24:43,546
they've put their families through and,

2018
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:47,049
and the relationships that have been permanently broken.

2019
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,485
I mean all the, all the burned bridges behind them

2020
01:24:49,518 --> 01:24:50,719
because they've done sex work.

2021
01:24:50,753 --> 01:24:52,388
You know most families aren't proud

2022
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:54,157
when their daughters become hookers.

2023
01:24:54,623 --> 01:24:59,395
I think the difference between me and the other girls

2024
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:03,132
in the industry was that I've really,

2025
01:25:03,166 --> 01:25:06,569
enjoyed being there and um, not just the sex

2026
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:09,672
I mean I, used it to better myself as a person.

2027
01:25:09,705 --> 01:25:12,575
I never let the industry take advantage of me in any way.

2028
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:14,743
I always took advantage of the industry.

2029
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:17,146
I made phenomenal amounts of money I've produced movies,

2030
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:19,815
I wrote movies, I starred in them,

2031
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:21,184
hell people were paying me hundreds

2032
01:25:21,217 --> 01:25:22,585
of dollars an hour to sign autographs?

2033
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,420
Woo hoo! I'm up, I'm with this!

2034
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:26,655
Um, I just, I- I...

2035
01:25:26,689 --> 01:25:28,591
The other girls leave with a bad taste in their mouth

2036
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:31,460
and they- and I just, I have nothing

2037
01:25:31,494 --> 01:25:33,095
but good memories when I look back.

2038
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,198
And right now if I wanted to go back into porn

2039
01:25:35,231 --> 01:25:36,599
I could probably go get a contract almost at any company

2040
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:38,501
and still just do straight boy-girl scenes.

2041
01:25:38,534 --> 01:25:39,802
And if I really wanted to when I'm thirty-two

2042
01:25:39,835 --> 01:25:41,537
if I wanna go back to porn and because I'm really broke

2043
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:43,606
maybe let's say, hopefully it won't happen,

2044
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:45,674
I would tell a porn company guess what,

2045
01:25:45,708 --> 01:25:47,610
I'm gonna come back and do two guys and do anal.

2046
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:50,213
If I'm thirty-five and really poor I need to do porn,

2047
01:25:50,246 --> 01:25:52,781
I'll tell 'em I'll do, you know, a black guy. Heh!

2048
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:54,783
There isn't that much of a future

2049
01:25:54,817 --> 01:25:57,720
after the x-rated industry because somehow,

2050
01:25:57,753 --> 01:25:59,722
somewhere, somebody will find you.

2051
01:25:59,755 --> 01:26:01,557
The famous line I used to say to anybody

2052
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:04,126
walking into my office when I ran the biggest agency,

2053
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,394
what are you gonna do ten years from now

2054
01:26:05,428 --> 01:26:07,196
when your kid brings home a magazine

2055
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:08,297
with you laying in the middle of it

2056
01:26:08,331 --> 01:26:09,532
with a candle shoved up your ass?

2057
01:26:09,565 --> 01:26:10,533
You gonna tell'em you were playing

2058
01:26:10,566 --> 01:26:11,800
the part of a birthday cake?

2059
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:13,836
It doesn't go away.

2060
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,872
My husband and my son changed my life.

2061
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:22,345
And my son saved my life.

2062
01:26:23,246 --> 01:26:28,217
(sigh) And looking at him every day,

2063
01:26:28,251 --> 01:26:33,155
reminds me how precious life is.

2064
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:37,660
And how throwing it away on drug and alcohol,

2065
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:40,663
just this stupid crap that's out there,

2066
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:43,932
god, it's just so not worth it. You know?

2067
01:26:44,233 --> 01:26:46,235
